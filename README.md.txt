# Web Scraping

Information: Here I add some of the web scraping notebooks I have developed in the past using Selenium, requests, and BeautifulSoup.

**1. Web scraping financial data from Macrotrends.net - My first scraper**

The first web scraper I created was a simple bot that extracted information from the website [macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/) my final goal was to use the data to create a Tableau visualization (which I have not finished yet...)

**2. Scraping Jobs from Indeed.com - Stepping up the game**

This is where I started using Selenium. I created a bot that goes to [indeed.com](indeed.com) and extracts the jobs according to whatever keywords your specify. I also included an analysis of the keywords to use for each position (business, data analyst, data scientist, machine learning engineer, software engineer).
