Triplebyte is transforming the way software engineers are hired. Our mission is to build an open, valuable and skills-based credential for all engineers and data scientists. This is important because millions of people have skills (and deserve good jobs), but don't fit the profile that recruiters seek. We aim to cut out that noise by matching opportunities to people who have the skills to succeed in them - regardless of their background.
Companies like Apple, Dropbox and American Express trust Triplebyte's technical assessment to identify the best engineers for their open roles and reduce the time and effort it takes to hire them.
We raised a $35 million Series B and our team of 64 is growing! We're building out the leadership of our team to help us scale to the next phase.

At AWS AI, we want to make it easy for our customers to deploy machine learning models in the cloud or at the edge. SageMaker provides a complete set of services to simplify the workflow of building, training, and deploying ML models. As one of the SageMaker services, Neo provides a deep learning compiler and runtime that is designed to run any machine learning model on any hardware.

Neo uses open source Apache TVM along with partner-provided compilers to optimizes machine learning models. After compilation, models perform at up to twice the speed of the original framework with no loss in accuracy. Upload a pre-trained model built with MXNet, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or XGBoost to your S3 bucket, choose your target hardware platform from Intel, NVIDIA, ARM, Ambarella, Qualcomm, NXP, or TI. With a single API call, SageMaker Neo optimizes the model, converts it into an executable module, and returns it to your S3 bucket. Then the free open source Neo runtime uses less than 100th of the space of the framework to run the model on the target hardware.

The SageMaker Neo team is growing rapidly to keep up with growth in customers and their requests. We are hiring well-rounded applied scientists and software developers with backgrounds in machine learning, compilers, systems, and AI accelerators. If you have worked on HPC and performance tuning, you will enjoy working on the breadth of ML applications that we optimize.

As a deep learning compiler developer, you will work on systematic approaches to improve the performance of deep learning models in Apache TVM. You will help develop the compilation service and runtime for machine learning while working at the frontier of the field where our team publishes its research. The work offers an extremely broad set of opportunities to work as a full stack SDE with exposure to multiple AI applications, ML frameworks, models, compilers, systems SW, and various AI hardware including ARM, Intel, Nvidia, AWS AI accelerators, and emerging edge AI ASICs.

Join the Amazon SageMaker Neo team to help AWS customers deploy machine learning models in the cloud and on edge devices at scale in production. Work on an open source industry-standard compiler and runtime for machine learning that is already deployed on millions of devices.

At AWS AI, we want to make it easy for our customers to deploy machine learning models on any endpoint in the cloud or at the edge. Just as SageMaker provides a complete set of services to simplify the task of building and training a model, Neo provides an inference engine that is designed to run any machine learning model on any hardware. Running machine learning inference on edge devices reduces latency, conserves bandwidth, improves privacy and enables smarter applications, and is a rapidly growing area as smart devices proliferate consumer and industrial applications.

Neo optimizes machine learning models to perform at up to twice the speed of the original framework with no loss in accuracy. Upload a pre-trained model built with MXNet, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or XGBoost to your S3 bucket, choose your target hardware platform from Intel, NVIDIA, or ARM, and with a single API call, SageMaker Neo optimizes the model, converts it into an executable module, and returns it to your S3 bucket. The free open source Neo runtime uses less than 100th of the space of the framework to run the model on the target hardware.

The SageMaker Neo Edge team is building new technology to deliver the most efficient inference on edge devices, coupled with ease of managing these devices. We are hiring well-rounded applied scientists and software developers with backgrounds in machine learning, embedded systems, compilers, and AI accelerators. If you have worked on running high performance computations on embedded devices, done performance tuning, developed software stacks on devices with limited compute and memory resources, you will enjoy working on the breadth of ML applications that we optimize.

You will help develop the runtime for machine learning, work with machine learning model compilers, and enable device and model management. You will engage with silicon vendors and device makers on enriching their on-device and device management service needs. The role offers an extremely broad set of opportunities to work as a full stack SDE with exposure to multiple AI applications, ML frameworks, ML models, compilers, embedded software, service software, and various AI hardware including ARM, Intel, AWS Inferentia, and NVidia.

Join the Amazon SageMaker Neo Edge team to help AWS customers deploy machine learning models on edge devices at scale in production. Work on an open source industry-standard compiler and runtime for machine learning that is already deployed on over 20 million devices.

"Data Scientist / Software Engineer, Planner",Waymo,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=55a5d877991f852d&fccid=73ceef0a2153d2b8&vjs=3,3 days ago,"Mountain View, CA",None,None,3.1,None,"Waymo is a self-driving technology company with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to get where they’re going. Since our start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has been focused on building the World’s Most Experienced Driver in hopes of improving the world's access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. Our Waymo Driver powers Waymo One, our autonomous ride-hailing service, as well as Waymo Via, our trucking and local delivery service. To date, Waymo has driven over 20 million miles autonomously on public roads across 25 U.S. cities and conducted over 15 billion miles of simulation testing.

The Planner Evaluation team is working on one of the most challenging problems in autonomous driving: building algorithms to assess the safety and quality of our self-driving cars at scale. Evaluation at scale is of paramount importance in solving autonomous driving: the algorithms we build orient the development of planner software by defining the north star and thus enabling rapid iteration. Almost every improvement to Waymo’s planner is influenced by our work, indirectly (by providing the quality signals for onboard engineers to aim for) or directly (by incorporating our algorithms into our onboard motion planning code). This is no easy feat. As our self-driving car gets better and accumulates more miles, we need rigorous and intelligent methods to automatically assess whether a scene is risky, a maneuver causes discomfort, or an interaction with pedestrians or other drivers could be managed better. This can be done through geometric reasoning, simulation, machine learning, and/or modeling with statistical distributions. Developing evaluation algorithms in self-driving is an uncharted space and thus requires true ingenuity. If you are excited about leveraging a large volume of extremely rich data in an area with lots of unexplored territory to help the advent of self-driving technology, this is the place for you!

In this hybrid role, you will:
Develop signals to describe the quality of our self driving car's behavior, using a range of techniques including machine learning, statistics, math, and physics
Design creative uses of simulation to measure those signals
Work closely with statisticians, machine learning engineers, and roboticists to develop novel solutions to open problems

We'd like you to have:
MS in Computer Science, Robotics, Statistics, Physics, Math or another quantitative area
3 years of industry experience
Python especially for modeling and/or statistical computing
Experience with tools for manipulating big data
Experience with machine learning or large scale statistical analysis
Problem-oriented mindset instead of only a solutions-oriented approach

It's preferred if you have:
PhD in Computer Science, Robotics, Statistics, Physics, Math or another quantitative area
Comfort with writing production code in C++
Experience in robotics or with spatial data in another field"

So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.

About the Role
CrowdStrike Falcon Host is a two-component security product. One component is a “sensor”: a driver installed on client machines that observes system activity and recognizes malicious behavior, then provides on-box prevention capability and remote telemetry to the Falcon Host cloud. The sensor processes thousands of events per second to provide deep visibility into operations on the endpoint, and performs rich correlation and computation to identify malicious events and blocks malicious activity.

The cloud component aggregates sensor telemetry for each customer’s network, correlates malicious behavior across multiple machines, and presents our customers’ operations teams with a prioritized summary of the threats detected in their environments.

This is a senior Software Development Engineer (SDE) role in the engineering team that delivers the sensor (lightweight agent) on Linux. SDE’s in the team own design and development of core features on the platform. Features will cross-cut most core OS subsystems such as file system, memory, process, and networking. Many features are also built in a way that they will have shared components across Windows and Mac. The team operates under the Agile development principles and ships frequently.

Responsibilities
Design and develop Linux software for deployment on server
Own features from design to delivery
Collaborate with multi-functional team in various physical locations
Troubleshoot issues with the product as reported from customers responsively
Other projects as assigned

What You’ll Need
Can develop high-quality code in C/C++ and can demonstrate that capability, be it through job experience, schoolwork, or contributions to community projects
Experience on Linux or Unix developing product code with the following characteristics:
high concurrency requirements needing strong use of multi-threading
high reliability requirements
detailed requirements on low-level operating characteristics (memory usage, efficient performance, correct conformance to external standards)
Experience working on a team to ship major features and releases
Able to communicate, collaborate, and work effectively in a distributed team

You can differentiate between when new platforms, frameworks, and design patterns solve real problems and when they’re just shiny objects, and even more importantly, know how to communicate that knowledge to everyone who needs to know it. You’re comfortable expressing your thoughts clearly in writing. You’re collaborative and enjoy teaching people what you know, but also are receptive and open when someone else is in a position to teach you.

"Backend Software Engineer, Machine Learning",Loon,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=0e2619ed92c0a98d&fccid=d6169c6e95113966&vjs=3,30+ days ago,"Mountain View, CA",None,None,5.0,None,"About Loon
Loon is on a mission to connect people everywhere by inventing and integrating audacious technology. Loon is built on a sophisticated system of products and services that combine advancements in materials science, atmospheric modeling, machine learning, and communications systems. These platforms enable Loon to harness the stratosphere, transforming global connectivity and creating endless possibilities for new applications by bridging ground, sky and space.
Overview
Loon's network orchestration stack is a Temporospatial Software-Defined Network (TS-SDN) for networks that span land, sea, air, and space. It was designed from the ground-up to support multiple aerospace networking projects, which until relatively recently included non-geostationary satellite constellations, in addition to the balloon-based production network that it orchestrates today at Loon.
Large enterprises and startups are racing to build their own non-geostationary constellations of satellites and high-altitude platforms to provide affordable, broadband Internet service to the billions of people that still lack access to it. But no single solution can solve the problem; just as population densities on Earth are non-uniform and span roughly five orders of magnitude, the tradeoff between coverage and capacity-density will require five altitude layers (towers, stratospheric platforms, low-earth orbiting, mid-earth-orbiting, and geostationary orbiting satellites).
Enabling the stratospheric layer and the ability for high-altitude platforms to internetwork with the layers above and below is of key strategic interest to Loon. As such, Loon is externalizing its network orchestration stack and transforming it into a multi-tenant production service to enable the internetworking and coordination of the world's aerospace networks.
Loon is seeking an experienced Software Engineer with graph theory, operations research, and machine learning experience to lead development of our next-generation network optimization engine for satellites and high-altitude platforms. This engine will determine the schedule of beam handovers, radio frequency channel assignments, and network paths that should be used, over time, by a heterogeneous network of ground stations, satellites, balloons, solar gliders, maritime vessels, commercial airlines, and end user devices on Earth. It must also minimize network disruption and packet loss as the network continuously evolves - and rapidly repair the network in the face of any unpredicted link failures.
Responsibilities
Investigate and down-select from a number of possible strategies for the next-generation solver.
Align stakeholders and build confidence in your proposed strategy.
Lead a small team of 2-3 software engineers (inclusive) to train and turn-up a production serving model within ~18-24 months.
Minimum Qualifications
Strong understanding of reinforcement learning and contextual bandits problems.
Production experience training and serving traffic using ML models.
Experience designing large scale systems and implementing core components.
Fluency in one of {C++, Go, Java}, with interest in developing proficiency in all three.
Preferred Qualifications
Experience with or interest in aerospace systems including communications satellites.
Experience with or interest in networking, including wireless communications and software defined networks,"

At AWS AI, we want to make it easy for our customers to deploy machine learning models on any endpoint in the cloud or at the edge. Just as SageMaker provides a complete set of services to simplify the task of building and training a model, Neo provides an inference engine that is designed to run any machine learning model on any hardware. Running machine learning inference on edge devices reduces latency, conserves bandwidth, improves privacy and enables smarter applications, and is a rapidly growing area as smart devices proliferate consumer and industrial applications.

Neo optimizes machine learning models to perform at up to twice the speed of the original framework with no loss in accuracy. Upload a pre-trained model built with MXNet, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or XGBoost to your S3 bucket, choose your target hardware platform from Intel, NVIDIA, or ARM, and with a single API call, SageMaker Neo optimizes the model, converts it into an executable module, and returns it to your S3 bucket. The free open source Neo runtime uses less than 100th of the space of the framework to run the model on the target hardware.

The SageMaker Neo Edge team is building new technology to deliver the most efficient inference on edge devices, coupled with ease of managing these devices. We are hiring well-rounded applied scientists and software developers with backgrounds in machine learning, embedded systems, compilers, and AI accelerators. If you have worked on running high performance computations on embedded devices, done performance tuning, developed software stacks on devices with limited compute and memory resources, you will enjoy working on the breadth of ML applications that we optimize.

Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. We’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and people – clearly confirming our industry leadership and our special culture driving it. We also offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.

About the Role
This is a specialized Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) position within the Strategic Research Initiatives (SRI) team, which works closely with the sensor engineering team to develop and release advanced product initiatives. As a key contributor to the team’s focus on quality and performance of the sensor kernel components, the ideal candidate will be proficient in low-level performance profiling of kernel drivers across supported platforms and technologies. This role will also require periodic driver development in C/C++, as well as test harness and framework improvements in Python.

Here are some typical quality-focused tasks that you will be heavily involved in:

Analyze complex software features, and build effective test strategies and test design

Build useful tools, frameworks, and test setup to use for developing tests effectively; the goal is to minimize manual testing and for the team to write automated tests for the product

Identify and write specialized tests necessary that are not feature-specific but are still important to ensure the quality of the system as a whole – performance, scalability, limits etc.

Debug bugs found through test or customer cases to identify root cause and use the input to improve tests

Work collaboratively with product and release management to control risk, improve quality, and streamline our release cycles

Rigorous product and test code reviews with an eye towards improving the security and robustness of the system as a whole

SDETs use their strong software development skills to build effective tools, harnesses, and specialized tests to assure that quality. SDETs also participate actively in design and code reviews, and collaborate with the cloud team to assure end-to-end system functionality.

The ideal SDET candidate must have demonstrated passion to find bugs -- i.e. they must like breaking software as much as writing code! They also must have demonstrated ability to write high-quality code in C or C++ and scripting languages like Python. Experience on Unix or Linux with code that has high reliability requirements; code that needs to pay attention to low-level operating characteristics (memory usage, efficient performance, correct conformance to external standards) is also highly desired.

Though the following are not all required for this position at the outset, strong SDETs in the team eventually build the following skills:

Deeper understanding of fundamental computer science concepts; experience in analysis and implementation of data structures, algorithms, and software design

Ability to write and automate test cases, triage bugs, and write actionable bug reports

Ability to read code with a focus on its robustness and security (or lack thereof)

Ability to clearly define test strategies for features, and implement those strategies

A track record of shipping quality software

The team provides strong mentoring and management support to develop these skills while working on their core deliverables. SDETs also have the opportunity, along with SDEs, to learn more about the tools, techniques, and procedures employed in attacks on our customers and to use this knowledge in challenging the entire team to constantly improve Falcon’s capabilities.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We are looking for motivated, fast-learning developers who are excited to build products that scale to millions of visitors every day.
At its core, our product uses artificial intelligence to learn how users interact with digital content and proactively delivers the optimal front end for every visitor to our customers' sites. We've built tools to automatically generate progressive web apps, in-depth reporting dashboards to give publishers novel insights into their users, data pipelines to process hundreds of millions of events, and tools to vastly increase throughput and effectiveness of our machine learning decisions, just to name a few. We're continuously growing, and we're looking for frontend and backend developers who love building and solving problems across the entire tech stack.
Technologies you'll work with:
Big Data: It's the backbone of everything we do. We use Redshift and MySQL to store just about everything you could imagine about a visitor's interactions with digital content.
Machine Learning: We use tensorflow, scikit-learn, Python, Golang, and state-of-the-art tools we've developed in-house to make data-driven decisions about the kinds of ads, content, and layouts to show each visitor.
Web Development: We build customer-facing dashboards, apps, and internal tools using whatever framework is best for the job, whether it's Vue.js, Angular, JS, Go or PHP. Plus, with a wide variety of digital publishers, you'll get experience working with a diverse set of web development technologies.
Cloud Computing: Our stack is built primarily upon AWS (EC2, Dynamo, RDS, Kinesis, etc.), along with other tools such as Kubernetes, Docker, and Apache Spark.
What you'll need:
5+ years of experience as a software engineer
Strong coding fundamentals: you're an expert in at least one language (e.g. Golang, Python, JavaScript, C++), and you're eager to learn more.
Web development experience (AJAX, HTML, CSS, PHP, React, Angular, etc.)
Experience with databases (PostgreSQL, Redshift, MySQL, or similar)
A drive to solve problems
Life as an Ezoic engineer:
Ezoic is an inaugural member of the Google Certified Publishing Partner Program. This means we work closely with Google to help websites optimize their ad revenue. We actually have won awards directly from Google for the artificial intelligence that we've built. Cool, right?!?
Ezoic is a technology-first company. Our CEO is a developer by trade, and our engineers are given all the tools needed to succeed. We empower our engineers to make a lot of their own decisions about both design and implementation, and encourage them to come up with new ideas to improve the application. We also aim to keep a good work-life balance, based on our philosophy that happy engineers are more productive. We want you to be working on something that you are passionate about and allow engineers to move around to keep things fresh.
While we are all working remotely now because of Covid, we have a brand new office in Carlsbad, CA, where we plan to return next year sometimes when the world goes back to normal. Every engineer works at their own quad-monitor setup on a standing desk. We pride ourselves on getting stuff done, but when you need a break, Ezoic offers great perks, including unlimited vacation time, catered lunches, snacks, flexible hours, ping pong, video games, and pool.

It is also the most flexible portfolio of Deep Learning accelerators. Xilinx FPGA makes it easy to optimize each accelerator for a specific user application. It is also easy to experiment with state-of-the-art techniques (such as quantization or pruning).

As such, Vitis-AI software is not custom code tuned for one Machine Learning application. You will join us in our exciting effort to design and implement a simple, robust and general Software Stack to efficiently deploy all current and future FPGA accelerators.

As a Sr Staff Software Engineer, you will be a core member in our global team of RTL, Compiler, Software and Application Engineers.

Today, engineers working on scalable applications repeatedly solve the same problems over and over like scheduling tasks, handling machine failures, and transferring data efficiently. Build the next generation of tools and infrastructure to make developing and running distributed applications in the cloud as easy as on your laptop. Part of this work will be open source as part of Ray. This work will allow programmers to develop applications much more rapidly and at a much higher level of abstraction.

We are looking for senior hires as well as less experienced but motivated individuals.

About Anyscale:
Anyscale provides an application development platform for developers to build distributed applications. We’re commercializing a popular open source project called Ray, which is a framework for distributed computing as well as an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning. Our goal is to build a standardized platform for distributed computing. Ray was developed at UC Berkeley by Robert Nishihara and Philipp Moritz, under the guidance of Ion Stoica and Michael Jordan, and the four of them have co-founded Anyscale. The company raised a $20.6M Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) with participation from NEA, Intel Capital, Ant Financial, Amplify Partners, 11.2 Capital, and The House Fund.

With Ray, we're making it easy to program at any scale (from your laptop to the datacenter) by providing easy-to-use, general-purpose, and high-performance tools. In addition, we are building a rich ecosystem of libraries (for reinforcement learning, hyperparameter search, experiment management, machine learning training, prediction serving, and more) on top of the core distributed system so that users can rapidly build sophisticated applications. Help us build the future of software development.

We are looking for passionate, motivated people who are excited to build tools to power the next generation of cloud applications.
As part of your role you will:
Develop high quality software to empower software developers and simplify programming
Work with a team of leading distributed systems and machine learning experts
Communicate your work to a broader audience through talks, tutorials, and blog posts
Help us to build and shape a world class company
Requirements:
At least 2 years of relevant work experience
Must be willing to work onsite in our office.

This exact role may not be open today, but could open in the near future. When you apply, a Cisco representative may contact you directly if a relevant position opens.
What You'll Do
Have you ever dreamt of joining a highly skilled team to build a ground breaking product with a start-up spirit, yet the power of the top networking company in the world? This is the mission of our team. We are actively hiring highly-skilled engineers, with a true passion for innovation. Our mission is to build a new generation of routing engine for the Internet deeply using Data Analytics, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The size, diversity, and richness of our data are, simply unmatched. The Internet is changing fast, and we are too. The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You thrive in dynamic environments that require a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code and an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion for innovation and the excitement of turning wildly disruptive ideas into products that impact the industry at large. We are building Cisco’s next-generation technological innovation by combining machine learning and distributed software with networking technologies.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with hands-on experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of complex and intricate datasets for web and mobile applications. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.
You hold a Ph.D. in computer science, Machine Learning, Statistics, or other data-science related field. You can demonstrate a strong track record in the following areas:
Strong background in statistics and machine learning is required, preferably with 5 to 10 years of industrial experience .
Ability to explore large datasets and find key descriptive and inferential properties in large and diverse datasets. Identify patterns and interactions in the data, and to clearly articulate impact of such data properties on proposed usecases.
Strong programming skills in Python, with an ability to manipulate large and complex datasets using distributed computing technologies (e.g., Apache Spark).

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

Machine learning and data science are at our core, and we're building a rare computational team that works closely with our biologists, together fighting disease.

Impact
Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases on Earth — cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, muscle wasting, and more — and drugs that slow the biological damage accumulated while aging have the potential to reduce the incidences of these diseases, possibly simultaneously. We believe that in the not-too-distant future, the discovery of therapies for aging will provide some of the most effective tools in history for reducing our burden of disease and extending our healthy lifespan.

Our mission is to dramatically accelerate the realization of that future. And we’re bringing a new set of machine learning tools to bear on this challenge.

Yes, you belong
We are building a cross-functional team. We don't expect you to have a background in biology, just as we don't expect our biologists to be experts in ML. We do expect our teams to work respectfully and closely, learning together every day.

We value building a diverse, inclusive environment and welcome all applicants regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.
About you
Experience. You have 3+ years of real-world experience in data science, software development, or machine learning.
Maturity in face of ambiguity. You help define questions instead of just answering them. You work to resolve ambiguity — and you're comfortable making decisions when it remains.
Analytical intuition. You're comfortable dealing with data and forming and testing hypotheses. You have a developed sense of whether analysis lacks rigor and how to improve it.
Love answering questions that help others. You get energy being faced with a series of questions that are important for others’ work and driving quickly towards answers that help them.
Tends towards ownership. You’re able to lead an analysis from the earliest stages of acquiring data all the way through to reaching conclusions from that data.
Crisp communicator. You excel at crisp, concise written or spoken communication. You love learning and teaching others in a cross-functional team (we're biologists, computational folks, and more).
Driven by impact. You're most motivated when working on a problem of important consequence, no matter what's necessary to do so.

Nice to have
Biological data experience. You bring familiarity with the pitfalls and analytical techniques typically encountered with large biological datasets.
Deep learning intuition. You bring intuition about datasets and experiment structures for deep learning from personal experience.
Scientific background. You have cultural familiarity with scientists and labs from personal experience. You know the language of scientists as well as that of the technical world.
Benefits
Competitive salary and equity in a growing, well-funded startup
Excellent medical, dental, and vision coverage
Generous vacation policy
Healthy feedback-focused environment — leadership will have high expectations, regularly share constructive feedback, expect you to grow, and welcome receiving feedback from you

A unique moment
We have deep support from some of the best investors in the world: General Catalyst, First Round, Felicis, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, pharma/biotech angels, and many more. Our advisors are world leaders in aging research, senior execs at pharma, and top tech entrepreneurs.

And at the same time, we're just getting started. You're joining a team that has the funding needed to be ambitious while still early enough to help define our culture, choices, and success. Our expectations of you — and of ourselves — are high.

To fighting disease, together!"

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects.

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. We’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and people – clearly confirming our industry leadership and our special culture driving it. We also offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.

About the Role:
Crowdstrike is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our growing Engine and Content Development (ECD) team which focuses on security related endpoint development on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The Engine and Content Development team is a central part of CrowdStrike’s mission - “We Stop Breaches."" In ECD, we implement strategies and processes that detect suspicious or malicious behavior. Our goal is to automatically stop the bad guys where possible, and to provide useful visibility and guidance to security analysts when new previously unknown adversary activity occurs. We research attacker behavior to understand their tools and techniques, and we build capabilities to detect and prevent malicious activity. Our detection strategies are often performed directly on the endpoint, but are also executed in cloud and may utilize a hybrid strategy combining aspects of both environments. This ability to leverage a variety of tools across the CrowdStrike stack allow us to accomplish our detection goals while balancing local resource utilization and false positives for our customers.

As a sensor engineer within the ECD team you will be focused on the analysis and development of detections for Windows based attack techniques across supported Windows OS versions. You’ll work collaboratively to implement these detections within the Falcon sensor which is a lightweight kernel-level module that observes system activity, recognizes malicious behavior, provides on-box prevention capability, and sends relevant security related data and telemetry to the Falcon cloud. You’ll help develop creative and resourceful ways to detect Windows specific threats while also helping develop cross platform features that cut across core OS subsystems such as analysis of file system, memory, process, and network telemetry. You’ll get exposure to both user-level and kernel-level coding practices. You’ll collaborate with multiple teams within engineering, and will be expected to make significant contributions to the design and implementation of major development projects. We're looking for smart people who want to be challenged and take ownership of what they build.

You will:
Design and build detection logic and systems leveraged across teams within CrowdStrike to detect cyber attackers and stop breaches.

Extend our existing codebase and test suites utilizing C++, Python, and other tools as appropriate.

Brainstorm, define, and build collaboratively across multiple teams.

Build elegant, robust, and reliable solutions for complex technical problems.

Obsess about learning, and champion the newest technologies & tricks with others, raising the technical IQ of the team.

Deliver and accept feedback with grace and courtesy.

Troubleshoot issues within the product when necessary, assisting customer support.

Leverage your understanding of engineering best practices, including topics like secure coding, testing paradigms, effective peer code reviews, logging, and resilient architecture patterns, to ensure that our code is clean.

Be an energetic ‘self-starter’ with the ability to take ownership and be accountable for deliverables, both individually and when leading a team.

Key Qualifications:
5+ years of experience with EITHER one of:
Reverse engineering, threat detection, and malware analysis; and an interest in on-device development, or

Designing, building, and delivering high-quality software in C/C++ with an interest in security.

Low-level OS knowledge of Windows operating system internals, components, APIs, and design.

Team player – able to lead, mentor, communicate, collaborate, and work effectively in a globally distributed team.

Preferred Qualifications:
Prior security experience, particularly in exploit and vulnerability analysis.

Prior experience working with low-level code, such as OS kernel, firmware or device drivers.

Low-level OS knowledge and experience with one of more of our supported sensor platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Understanding of kernel-mode and multi-threaded concurrent systems development in any of our supported platforms, with an interest to grow skills in all of them.

Prior development or testing experience with python.

Prior experience delivering software via agile processes.

Square builds common business tools in unconventional ways so more people can start, run, and grow their businesses. When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We’re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms—and we’re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.

Job Description
We work to guarantee the security of every transaction from dip and tap to receipt. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that there is no possible way to use Square insecurely. In the Mobile Security group, we work to fluidly interpret signals from what could be a compromised or hostile environment - the OS and app running our code. We build workflows, both human and machine, to swiftly judge the requests for privilege that come with those signals, and we hunt the malefactor where they work.
An example of this is our work to support and validate PIN-on-Glass, the ability of our apps to receive entry of a customer PIN after an EMV card dip into our reader. This is a constrained and sensitive transaction, controlled previously entirely by the banking industry, into which we were not only able to introduce our low-cost, easy-access product, but to also influence the industry itself and its newest standards.
We look for software engineers who understand both security and the human cost of securing a digital border. We need people who recognize that a false positive is a frustrated customer, that an engineer's investigations are a limited commodity, and that threats are not always what they seem. We cannot succeed without elegant and scalable tooling, which is what you will build.
You will:
Lead and contribute to projects that span the following
Signals processing and secure operations on mobile devices
Security incident review
Information flow and efficiency modeling
Case management user interfaces and backends
Applied machine learning in security contexts
Native library development for Android and iOS apps

Qualifications
You have:
3+ years of industry experience
A background in software engineering with a deep passion for making all things efficient
Examples of secure and elegant software development on production systems
Experience developing, deploying, and monitoring systems for managing and scaling security investigations, judgements, and actions

About the Role: CrowdStrike Falcon Host is a two-component security product. One component is a “sensor”: a driver installed on client machines that observes system activity and recognizes malicious behavior, then provides on-box prevention capability and remote telemetry to the Falcon Host cloud. The sensor processes thousands of events per second to provide deep visibility into operations on the endpoint, and performs rich correlation and computation to identify malicious events and blocks malicious activity. The cloud component aggregates sensor telemetry for each customer’s network, correlates malicious behavior across multiple machines, and presents our customers’ operations teams with a prioritized summary of the threats detected in their environments. We are looking for an Engineering Manager for the team that delivers the sensor (lightweight agent) on Linux. The ideal candidate will be a self-motivated individual with a track record of hiring and retaining a team that delivers great software.
Engineers in this team design and implement new features to surface containers as logical end-points in the end-to-end Falcon product. These features will deliver the power of the Falcon end-point protection platform for Docker and other container implementations built on top of LXC. The team operates under the agile development principles and ships frequently.
What You’ll Need
Attract, develop, and grow top technical talent to continue building our technical leadership in the industry
BS degree or equivalent in CS or a related Engineering field
1-2 years of current experience in software engineering management
3-5 years of prior experience in software development
Experience delivering customer facing features through design, architecture, and development
Experience in software development life cycle using both agile and waterfall methodology
Excellent organizational and interpersonal skills

About the Product:
CrowdStrike Falcon Host is a two-component security product. One component is a “sensor”, which is a lightweight agent installed on client machines that observes system activity and recognizes malicious behavior, then provides on-box prevention capability and remote telemetry to the Falcon Host cloud. The cloud component aggregates sensor telemetry for each customer’s network, can correlate malicious behavior across multiple machines, and presents our customers’ operations teams with a prioritized summary of the threats detected in their environments.

What You’ll Be Doing:
This is a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) position in the Linux sensor engineering team. This role will be working in a part of the team developing new features to surface containers as logical end-points in the end-to-end Falcon product. These features will deliver the power of the Falcon end-point protection platform for Docker and other container implementations in popular container environments such as Kubernetes clusters.

At CrowdStrike, SDETs and SDEs work together in combined engineering teams. SDETs are key contributors in the team’s focus on quality of the sensor. SDETs use their strong software development skills to build effective tools, harnesses, and specialized tests to assure that quality. SDETs also participate actively in design and code reviews, and collaborate with the cloud team to assure end-to-end system functionality.

The ideal SDET candidate must have demonstrated passion to find bugs -- i.e. they must like breaking software as much as writing code! They also must have demonstrated the ability to write high-quality code in C or C++ and scripting languages like Python. Experience on Unix or Linux with code that has high reliability requirements; code that needs to pay attention to low-level operating characteristics (memory usage, efficient performance, correct conformance to external standards) is also highly desired.

Here are the quality-focused tasks in the team that SDETs are heavily involved in:
Analyze complex software features, and build effective test strategies and test design
Build useful tools, frameworks, and test setup to use for developing tests effectively; the goal is to minimize manual testing and for the team to write automated tests for the product
Identify and write specialized tests necessary that are not feature-specific but are still important to ensure the quality of the system as a whole – performance, scalability, limits etc.
Debug bugs found through test or customer cases to identify root cause and use the input to improve tests
Work collaboratively with product and release management to control risk, improve quality, and streamline our release cycles
Rigorous product and test code reviews with an eye towards improving the security and robustness of the system as a whole

What You’ll Need:
Deeper understanding of fundamental computer science concepts; experience in analysis and implementation of data structures, algorithms, and software design
Ability to write and automate test cases, triage bugs, and write actionable bug reports
Ability to read code with a focus on its robustness and security (or lack thereof)
Ability to clearly define test strategies for features, and implement those strategies
A track record of shipping quality software
Experience in writing and automating tests for container runtime engines, software that monitors containers, or optimized virtual machine environments to run containers.

About the Role
CrowdStrike Falcon Host is a two-component security product. One component is a “sensor”: a driver installed on client machines that observes system activity and recognizes malicious behavior, then provides on-box prevention capability and remote telemetry to the Falcon Host cloud. The sensor processes thousands of events per second to provide deep visibility into operations on the endpoint, and performs rich correlation and computation to identify malicious events and blocks malicious activity.

The cloud component aggregates sensor telemetry for each customer’s network, correlates malicious behavior across multiple machines, and presents our customers’ operations teams with a prioritized summary of the threats detected in their environments.

This is a senior Software Development Engineer (SDE) role in the engineering team that delivers the sensor (lightweight agent) on Linux. SDE’s in the team own design and development of core features on the platform. Features will cross-cut most core OS subsystems such as file system, memory, process, and networking. Many features are also built in a way that they will have shared components across Windows and Mac. The team operates under the Agile development principles and ships frequently.

Responsibilities
Design and develop Linux software for deployment on server
Own features from design to delivery
Collaborate with multi-functional team in various physical locations
Troubleshoot issues with the product as reported from customers responsively
Other projects as assigned

What You’ll Need
Can develop high-quality code in C/C++ and can demonstrate that capability, be it through job experience, schoolwork, or contributions to community projects
Experience on Linux or Unix developing product code with the following characteristics:
high concurrency requirements needing strong use of multi-threading
high reliability requirements
detailed requirements on low-level operating characteristics (memory usage, efficient performance, correct conformance to external standards)
Experience working on a team to ship major features and releases
Able to communicate, collaborate, and work effectively in a distributed team

These special rates are exclusive to us saving consumers thousands of dollars each and rewarding them for living a healthy lifestyle.
Hyper-growth means hyper opportunity for employees! While many companies hire managers externally or use a tenure system, we pride ourselves on our cultural value of meritocracy. This means that as we grow and new positions are created, we look to promote our top performers from within. Today over 80% of our managers are promoted from internal roles.
Health IQ believes that everyone can make an impact, and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer committed to providing employment opportunity regardless of sex, race, creed, color, gender, religion, marital status, domestic partner status, age, national origin or ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, pregnancy, military or veteran status, citizenship status, and genetic information.

Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. We’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and people – clearly confirming our industry leadership and our special culture driving it. We also offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.

About the Role
CrowdStrike is looking for a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) to join our growing Engine and Content Development (ECD) team which focuses on security related endpoint development on Windows, macOS, and Linux. We're looking for smart people who want to be challenged and take ownership of what they build, working in an environment where quality is the company culture.

The Engine and Content Development team is a central part of CrowdStrike’s mission - “We Stop Breaches."" In ECD, we implement strategies and processes that detect suspicious or malicious behavior. Our goal is to automatically stop the bad guys where possible, and to provide useful visibility and guidance to security analysts when new adversary activity occurs. We research attacker behavior to understand their tools and techniques, and we build capabilities to detect and prevent malicious activity. Our detection strategies are often performed directly on the endpoint, but are also executed in cloud and may utilize a hybrid strategy combining aspects of both environments. This ability to leverage a variety of tools across the CrowdStrike stack allows us to accomplish our detection goals while balancing local resource utilization and false positives for our customers.

As an SDET within the ECD team you will be focused on the validation of detections for attack techniques across supported operating systems. These detections are implemented in the Falcon sensor, which is a lightweight module that observes system activity, recognizes malicious behavior, provides on-box prevention capability, and sends relevant security related data and telemetry to the Falcon cloud. You’ll work collaboratively to build test suites for sensor features, including both on-device testing and end-to-end validation. You’ll get exposure to both user-level and kernel-level coding practices. You’ll collaborate with multiple teams within engineering, and will be expected to make significant contributions to the design and implementation of major development projects.

Success in this role means:
Breaking software systems in creative and useful ways.
Automating test processes for speed, reproducibility, and scalability.
Thinking strategically about test automation for multi-threaded kernel code.
Thriving with responsibility, challenges, and aggressive goals.
Collaborating both within and across teams to deliver quality software.
Building elegant, robust, and reliable solutions for complex technical problems.

You will:
Design, develop, verify, deploy and maintain automated test suites and frameworks utilizing C++, Python, and other tools as appropriate, working collaboratively, with a goal of minimizing manual testing.
Help ensure that our products are polished and deliver a good customer experience before and after they get into customers’ hands.
Contribute to detection logic and systems to detect cyber attackers and stop breaches.
Write clear and detailed bug reports when things break, and work with the team to identify and validate fixes.
Deliver and accept feedback with grace and courtesy.
Take ownership and be accountable for deliverables, both individually and when leading a team.

About the Role
CrowdStrike Falcon Host is a two-component security product. One component is a “sensor”: a driver installed on client machines that observes system activity and recognizes malicious behavior, then provides on-box prevention capability and remote telemetry to the Falcon Host cloud. The sensor processes thousands of events per second to provide deep visibility into operations on the endpoint, and performs rich correlation and computation to identify malicious events and blocks malicious activity.

The cloud component aggregates sensor telemetry for each customer’s network, correlates malicious behavior across multiple machines, and presents our customers’ operations teams with a prioritized summary of the threats detected in their environments.

This is a Senior Software Development Engineer (SDE) role in the engineering team that delivers the sensor (lightweight agent) on Mac OS X. SDE’s in the team own design and development of core features on the platform. Features will cross-cut most core OS subsystems such as file system, memory, process, and networking. Many features are also built in a way that they will have shared components across Windows and Linux. The team operates under the Agile development principles and ships frequently.

Responsibilities

Design and develop software for deployment on Mac OS X systems

Own features from design to delivery

Collaborate with multi-functional team in various physical locations

Troubleshoot issues with the product as reported from customers responsively

Other projects as assigned

What You’ll Need

Can develop high-quality code in C/C++ and can demonstrate that capability, be it through job experience, schoolwork, or contributions to community projects

Experience on Mac OS X developing product code with the following characteristics:

high concurrency requirements needing strong use of multi-threading

high reliability requirements

detailed requirements on low-level operating characteristics (memory usage, efficient performance, correct conformance to external standards)

Experience working on a team to ship major features and releases

Able to communicate, collaborate, and work effectively in a distributed team

You already know how to interface with a product team, support team, marketing team, and leadership team to make everything run more smoothly.
You can differentiate between when new platforms, frameworks, and design patterns solve real problems and when they’re just shiny objects, and even more importantly, know how to communicate that knowledge to everyone who needs to know it. You’re comfortable expressing your thoughts clearly in writing. You’re collaborative and enjoy teaching people what you know, but also are receptive and open when someone else is in a position to teach you.
In return, you’ll work in an environment that welcomes responsibility, where your work will help millions of people focus on the most rewarding parts of their jobs, and as part of a friendly, fun, elite team.

Full-Stack Engineer,Render,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=2c1b2b293fea5a7b&fccid=fb248e973626d73d&vjs=3,30+ days ago,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,None,None,"When deploying applications in production, developers are forced to pick between two extremes: expensive yet simplistic platforms like Heroku, or complicated, do-it-all-yourself services like AWS. By contrast, Render makes it easy to get up and running quickly but also allows applications to scale and increase in complexity over time, preventing a transition to DIY infrastructure.

Our goal is to completely free up developers and teams from managing infrastructure. This will ultimately improve all software and enable entirely new kinds of applications.

We're building products that abstract over complexity and minimize cognitive overhead for our users. This requires careful thought, high creativity and a deep understanding of application requirements in production. Our stack is React, GraphQL, Go, Kubernetes and PostgreSQL, but we don't require prior experience with any of them. We're looking for engineers with high integrity, low ego, and an insatiable drive to learn.

Our platform serves over a billion requests every month, and we have tens of thousands of users including Stripe, NYU, and US presidential campaigns. We have product-market fit and rapidly increasing revenue, and we're backed by the same early stage investors behind Airbnb, Snap, and Stripe.

As a full-stack engineer at Render, you will take complete, end-to-end ownership of projects across the entire stack. You should already have experience building products across the stack and have a keen understanding of web frameworks, APIs, databases and multiple backend languages.

Engineering at Render

We're a small team of world-class full-stack engineers. We have complete, end-to-end ownership for every project we take on and expect the same from you. We review all major code changes through pull requests and are always pushing ourselves to do better. We iterate quickly and deploy to production several times a day.

Technical challenges

The biggest issues with platforms like Heroku are lack of flexibility, and cost. We are solving the cost problem by using containers and Kubernetes and intelligently scaling compute resources up and down. This will continue to be a major area of engineering investment for us going forward.

We solve lack of flexibility by using Kubernetes under the hood and abstracting all the associated complexity so our users get all the benefits (load balancing, service discovery, autoscaling, health checks, self-healing) without needing to manage Kubernetes or build everything on AWS.

The challenge is in building the right user-facing abstractions that make simple application deployments effortless and complex application deployments possible. User experience is our primary focus and drives everything we do.
Why join us
We're solving a problem faced by every developer and development team. It's a massive and rapidly growing market (AWS is privately valued at over $200B, and there are over 20 million professional developers globally).
We serve over 1 billion requests every month, our users love us, and our revenue is growing quickly.
Our stock grants are in the 99th percentile.
Everyone wants to move their infrastructure to Kubernetes, but it's too complex for the average development team. Render makes it possible to get the power of Kubernetes without any of its complexity.
The former CTOs of VMware and Dropbox are two of our biggest investors and cheerleaders.
The company is led by Anurag Goel, who was employee #8 and Head of Risk at Stripe. He helped Stripe scale from 10 to over 400 people and is applying many of the same principles that helped Stripe succeed to Render.
Projects you might work on
You will create open source projects and documentation in multiple languages and frameworks to demo Render's features.
We run our Kubernetes clusters on Google Cloud Platform and AWS. You will enable Render's clusters to run on other clouds and eventually in our own data-centers. You will also allow our users to connect Render resources with their private networks in existing public cloud infrastructure.
You will create an effortless serverless abstraction on Render and enable per-request billing for containerized resources.
You will build a managed MySQL product for Render users.
You will use machine learning to optimize container scheduling and save resources while keeping user workloads responsive.
Render works great with GitHub and GitLab repos. You will add Bitbucket integration.
You will build out Render's CLI and make the user dashboard even better.
Some benefits we offer
Comprehensive medical, dental and vision coverage with PPO plans and 100% of your premiums paid by Render.
99th percentile stock grants and a comfortable San Francisco salary.
Four weeks paid vacation, and vacation days are only counted when you take more than one at a time.
Work from home if you have a delivery or chore to take care of.
3 months paid maternity and paternity leave.
Commuter benefits including Lyft and SF Muni passes.
A sunny, beautiful, well-stocked office in SoMa close to Caltrain and BART.
Monthly gym membership allowance.
Build your own laptop/workstation with any peripheral or accessory you need.
Use the company card to order any work-related ebook or p-book, and buy anything to make your work environment more ergonomic.
Financial and logistical assistance to help you relocate to the Bay Area.
Immigration assistance.
Birthday celebrations, weekly happy hours, company dinners, and semi-annual team retreats.
Surprise gifts for the holidays!
You are a great fit for this role if
You have a few years of professional experience building software. Bonus points if you’ve excelled at a small, high-growth startup.
You have an intuitive understanding of web frameworks, APIs, and databases, and have worked with multiple programming languages.
You are both curious by nature and an impressively quick learner.
You are unfazed by unfamiliar codebases and enjoy figuring things out on your own.
You can wear multiple hats and work across the stack, both collaboratively and independently.

The ideal candidate would check everything above, but you should certainly apply if you identify with most of it.
Working at Render

We value high integrity, low ego, an affinity for continuous learning, and the ability to figure things out quickly. We're always open to being wrong, and we love to improve our work through reasoned discussion and constant feedback. We trust and respect each other tremendously which makes doing all of this easy.

We'd love to hear from you!"

So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.

About the Role
We’re building a welcoming & flexible team that prizes collaboration over competition, one which provides opportunities to learn new skills, mentor junior developers and contribute to the direction of both the team & the products we’re responsible for. This is a high trust environment where we allow team members to manage their own time, take holidays as they need it and reward them with competitive salaries and equity.

Our stack is Ember, but if you've used frameworks like React or Angular you're the kind of person we're looking for and we'll help get you up to speed. As we support only evergreen browsers we can push the boundaries of what’s possible on the web as a platform, on top of a system that strips any hyperbole from the term “big data”. In close collaboration with analysts & clients you’ll get to see the apps & visualisations you’re building used every day to hunt for hackers and protect systems.

Our ideal candidates are sensitive to the needs of the users of their software & love learning more about their tools every day. Get excited about new features in Chrome Devtools? Tested your work in screen readers? Ever lost half an hour getting an animation’s bezier curve to be just the right kind of bouncy? Looking for a challenge that’s out of the ordinary? Get in touch.

The candidate will join our IT & Security Operations team to work on Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM).

CSPM is a new and complementary product area for CrowdStrike. We’re extending CrowdStrike’s mission of “stopping breaches” into the public cloud control plane and native cloud resources. CrowdStrike’s CSPM offering will give customers visibility into both the (mis)configuration and compliance of native cloud resources, and potential adversary activity involving those resources. When coupled with Falcon, CrowdStrike’s endpoint security offering, our CSPM offering will provide a more comprehensive perspective on how the adversary is targeting key customer infrastructure.

What You’ll Need
A desire to collaborate closely with users, designers, & testers to deliver quality software that solves problems.
A deep understanding of Javascript and considerable experience building thick-client applications with modern frameworks such as Ember, AngularJS, Backbone or React/Flux.
Experience with testing frameworks, tools and methodologies such as QUnit, Mocha & Selenium.
Functional knowledge & interest in developing genuinely accessible interfaces.
Strong HTML & CSS skills, with bonus points for experience with animation, knowledge of approaches to scalable/modular CSS, & preprocessors such as SCSS & LESS.
Familiarity with client-side build processes & tools - Grunt, Gulp, Ember CLI etc
Comfortable with Git/version control workflows.

Bonus Points Awarded For:
Experience creating or contributing to open source projects.
Experience with graphics & visualisation tools such as D3 or ThreeJS.
Interest & experience with design & data visualisation.
Experience with coaxing that last frame-per-second out of browsers.

"Backend Software Engineer, Machine Learning",Loon,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=0e2619ed92c0a98d&fccid=d6169c6e95113966&vjs=3,30+ days ago,"Mountain View, CA",None,None,5.0,None,"About Loon
Loon is on a mission to connect people everywhere by inventing and integrating audacious technology. Loon is built on a sophisticated system of products and services that combine advancements in materials science, atmospheric modeling, machine learning, and communications systems. These platforms enable Loon to harness the stratosphere, transforming global connectivity and creating endless possibilities for new applications by bridging ground, sky and space.
Overview
Loon's network orchestration stack is a Temporospatial Software-Defined Network (TS-SDN) for networks that span land, sea, air, and space. It was designed from the ground-up to support multiple aerospace networking projects, which until relatively recently included non-geostationary satellite constellations, in addition to the balloon-based production network that it orchestrates today at Loon.
Large enterprises and startups are racing to build their own non-geostationary constellations of satellites and high-altitude platforms to provide affordable, broadband Internet service to the billions of people that still lack access to it. But no single solution can solve the problem; just as population densities on Earth are non-uniform and span roughly five orders of magnitude, the tradeoff between coverage and capacity-density will require five altitude layers (towers, stratospheric platforms, low-earth orbiting, mid-earth-orbiting, and geostationary orbiting satellites).
Enabling the stratospheric layer and the ability for high-altitude platforms to internetwork with the layers above and below is of key strategic interest to Loon. As such, Loon is externalizing its network orchestration stack and transforming it into a multi-tenant production service to enable the internetworking and coordination of the world's aerospace networks.
Loon is seeking an experienced Software Engineer with graph theory, operations research, and machine learning experience to lead development of our next-generation network optimization engine for satellites and high-altitude platforms. This engine will determine the schedule of beam handovers, radio frequency channel assignments, and network paths that should be used, over time, by a heterogeneous network of ground stations, satellites, balloons, solar gliders, maritime vessels, commercial airlines, and end user devices on Earth. It must also minimize network disruption and packet loss as the network continuously evolves - and rapidly repair the network in the face of any unpredicted link failures.
Responsibilities
Investigate and down-select from a number of possible strategies for the next-generation solver.
Align stakeholders and build confidence in your proposed strategy.
Lead a small team of 2-3 software engineers (inclusive) to train and turn-up a production serving model within ~18-24 months.
Minimum Qualifications
Strong understanding of reinforcement learning and contextual bandits problems.

Unfortunately, PHI is difficult to protect and at the center of malicious cyberattacks. Healthcare has a multitude of data security software tools and defensive strategies in place, but they fall short in securing healthcare’s uniquely complex infrastructure. Further, with the advent of the COVID-19 crisis and more remote care, the patient data “attack surface” has increased exponentially. The need for what we are building has never been greater.
Tausight has created a breakthrough, multi-patented technology platform that will change how to best protect patient’s personal healthcare information. We are developing a sophisticated, actionable information architecture that will enable a superior user experience designed to better protect PHI. Powered by proprietary machine-learning algorithms, patented IoT sensing technology, and the Google Cloud DevOps platform, Tausight is reimagining how to enable healthcare CIOs and CISOs to make real-time decisions to protect PHI…much of which they can’t even see today.
As a full stack developer with emphasis on database engineering, you will work on a product that extracts data streams from complex healthcare provider environments, processes and analyzes these streams for useful insight, and feeds this back to our clients via a web application. You will own major components of this stack and be responsible for their performance, scalability, and reliability.
We strongly believe that Tausight is an exciting place to be, at an exciting time, and the best time to join our growing team is right now.
What You Will Do:
Design, implement, test, and scale major components of our data processing pipeline
Develop user-facing features for our Web UI application
Work closely with product teams implementing wireframes and feedback into high quality code
Be proactive as a developer who builds testable, resilient software
Effectively use tools and ingenuity to identify and fix defects
What You Need:
BS in Computer Science or related technical field involving coding
3+ years of software engineering experience
Experience with Javascript as well as an object-oriented language such as Java or C++
Understand engineering tradeoffs, valuing pragmatism over idealism.
Analytical approach coupled with strong communication skills
Shares the values of ownership, diversity of thought, and empathy for our users and coworkers
Nice to Have:
MS in Computer Science or related technical field involving coding (e.g., Mathematics)
Experience maintaining and debugging distributed systems in production environments
Experience with Google Cloud Platform technologies such as Pub/Sub, Dataflow, Datastore, BigQuery, or Kubernetes
Experience with Node, React, or GraphQL
Experience with CI/CD and testing automation frameworks
Why Tausight?
Data security is one of the fastest growing segments of the $3 trillion healthcare industry
Already backed by two leading healthcare technology VCs, Flare Capital and Polaris Partners
Cutting-edge platform, Google-powered streaming analytics, and novel predictive intelligence
Highly experienced team to learn from and to help develop your personal growth
Unlimited vacation; company holidays; medical/dental/eyecare
Stock options - early is the best time to get them
We work remotely. Already committed to remain this way through at least July 2021
We Believe.
We will not tolerate ageism, racism, gender or sexual harassment, or any form of discrimination within our business operations or places of work. To be abundantly clear, we are committed to diversity, equity and belonging within our culture and across our company. We believe in:
DIVERSITY - Our organization will be stronger and more resilient when we encompass a variety of experiences, opinions, and backgrounds. We will aim for a Tausight community of employees, board members, advisors, and partners that resembles the broader and far more diverse socio-economic and global world that we live in. Specifically, we will grow into a team of passionate, healthcare-dedicated individuals that span age, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, and race.
EQUITY - We will work toward fair outcomes for people and groups by treating them in ways that address their unique advantages or barriers.
BELONGING - All members of our community will feel equally valued and their voices and points of view are to be heard and respected. We will take deliberate actions to cultivate an atmosphere where all employees feel included, can contribute, and thrive.
About Us
Founded in 2018 by the cofounder and former CTO of Imprivata, David Ting, our Tausight mission is deeply inspired by a specific call to action “to ensure that PHI, and the systems and applications managing it, can always be trusted by the clinician and the patient.” Backed by the support of top-tier healthcare technology investors, Polaris Partners and Flare Capital Partners, our Tausight team has spent the last two years single-mindedly focused on protecting and de-risking PHI, within and across the entire decentralized healthcare ecosystem.
We are still an early-stage startup on the verge of passing the next critical milestone and about to move to the next level of product development and investor support. Our team is currently located within Boston, NH, and the Bay areas.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!
