Triplebyte is transforming the way software engineers are hired. Our mission is to build an open, valuable and skills-based credential for all engineers and data scientists. This is important because millions of people have skills (and deserve good jobs), but don't fit the profile that recruiters seek. We aim to cut out that noise by matching opportunities to people who have the skills to succeed in them - regardless of their background.
Companies like Apple, Dropbox and American Express trust Triplebyte's technical assessment to identify the best engineers for their open roles and reduce the time and effort it takes to hire them.
We raised a $35 million Series B and our team of 64 is growing! We're building out the leadership of our team to help us scale to the next phase.

Job Description
You are a data scientist - soon to be known for building the “thermometer for the mind”: a system that encompasses...
streaming smartphone sensor data providing measures of human behavior,
batched electronic health records providing measures of health outcomes, and
state-of-the-art algorithms that map #1 to #2
... in order to get substance-use disorder patients the help they need at their most critical moments of recovery.
You're excited about changing the way we manage mental healthcare, using machine learning and artificial intelligence. Your modeling expertise is broad - you're familiar with a wide variety of modeling approaches, and you have a depth of intuition to choose the right approach for each task. You keep the end goal of delivering customer value in mind. This means you seek and respond to customer feedback about your outputs, and you navigate your approach towards results. You're more focused on results than tools - though you stay abreast of exciting developments in machine learning, you'll use a simple approach if it's the right one for the job.
You're familiar with best practices for codebase management and data security. You'll create a codebase that is well-documented, elegantly designed, and easy for others to use. And you have a security mindset, which you'll apply to ensuring that our handling of sensitive data meets the highest standards.
You're a visionary who will influence the future of data science & analytics at Aware Healthcare. Your understanding of our goals and of the possibilities of statistical inference will guide our product development, and direct our collection of data. You are excited to effectively manage new collaborators as our data science team grows.
Responsibilities
Design and build our core algorithms.
Design and train models that predict key targets (e.g. substance-use relapse).
Combine datastreams from disparate time-scales (monthly, weekly, daily, etc.) with data from electronic health records, to build a real-time predictive system.
Deliver data insights to customers.
Produce insights in a timely manner to ensure our delivery schedule is met.
Seek feedback from customers and rework algorithms and strategies accordingly.
Organize and manage our data science codebase.
Keep all code updated in well-organized and documented git repository.
Manage others' contributions to the codebase.
Act as “Chief Privacy Officer” for analytics and pipelining of data.
Know best practices and regulations for working with sensitive health data.

Take leadership of the data science team.
Ensure the success of interns and other team members under your guidance.
Help decide which roles to hire for as the project grows.
Set strategy for our data science department.
Use experimental design considerations to shape our product, considering what data types we need and what we can predict from them.
Add your vision for how our products could grow and evolve.
Required Qualifications
Expert Python programmer, extremely proficient with the scipy stack (e.g. numpy, pandas, sci-kit learn, and matplotlib)
Broad and deep knowledge of machine learning algorithms, with a strong sense for which techniques fit a given situation.
Demonstrated ability to develop novel approaches to inference problems.
Experience working with version control tools such as git.
Extensive experience communicating technical findings to non-technical stakeholders.
Preferred Qualifications
Knowledgeable about securely handling sensitive data; experience working under a data security agreement (e.g. HIPAA BAAs).
Experience analyzing streaming, high-volume, noisy datasets, especially data from smartphones and wearable devices.
Previous contributions to enterprise-level software or analysis codebase.
Previous experience as an early employee at a fast-growing tech startup.
Leadership experience (hiring contractors, managing interns, etc).
Experience with cloud computing.
Experience in experimental design.
Experience analyzing electronic health records.
Who We Are: Aware Healthcare Inc.
Our Mission
Aware Healthcare is on a mission to build the “thermometer for the mind”: a digital medical device that delivers real-time measures of clinical risk to providers, about their patients, at the moments they need it most.
The current gold-standard of evaluation in psychiatry are pen & paper surveys that provide subjective, episodic, high-burden, and clinic-based measures of risk. Our thermometer allows providers to check the ‘mental temperature' of their patients — in an objective, continuous, ecological, and passive fashion — at any time.
Our Vision
With our thermometer, providers know who needs help, and when they need it. Not only does this shine light into the black box that currently defines life outside the clinic, but it allows providers to deliver just-in-time interventions to patients before it's too late. Trust in providers grows when patients know they're being looked out for. Population health flourishes when high-risk gets detected early. Per capita costs plummet when rates of readmission are reduced. Welcome to the triple-aim of healthcare.
We envision a world where we all have the vocabulary to describe how we're mentally feeling; self-awareness to identify when we're heading down a dark path; and tools to get help in minutes not weeks. We can't manage what we don't measure, so we see no more important problem than this for technology in healthcare.
Our Why
We are starting with addiction for several reasons. For one, it seems we've all been affected by or lost friends and family who have struggled with this chronic disease. Two, addiction is the most costly, preventable, and unmanaged disease in America; costing our nation over $700 billion per year and leading to over 70 other comorbid medical conditions. Three, most digital health companies have run away from addiction, because they see the problem as ‘too hard'; the patients as ‘unmanageable'; the suffering as ‘inevitable'. With over 16% of Americans meeting criteria for clinical addiction, and another 32% classifying as risky users, we see this as too big of a problem to ignore.
Join us in redefining what it means to know thyself, reconsidering how we measure population health, and revolutionizing the way we manage mental healthcare. Join us at Aware Healthcare.
How We Will Collaborate: Culture & Values
Work Culture
We're a small team looking for someone who's passionate about democratizing self-knowledge; relentless about getting help to those who need it most. You should be comfortable exploring outside your comfort zone; be ready to learn and constantly take on new challenges.
You should be known by your colleagues for never compromising on quality, while always moving quickly. On our team, no one is expected to know everything, but everyone is expected to be capable of learning independently, and applying that knowledge effectively.
This is a fast-paced role with many concurrent responsibilities, and it comes with a great deal of ownership. Chances are you will grow more in this role than any other role of your career. This idea should excite you, rather than scare you.
Team Values
Being on the Aware Healthcare team means you...
Take ownership: the buck stops at you; you are individually responsible.
Are proactive: you take initiative; identify problems before they happen.
Embrace risk: take courageous & calculated risks; no one gets banished for making mistakes.
Are radically candid: you expect truth and nothing but the truth; give & take constructive criticism.
Have a growth-mindset: we believe you can always be better & you should too; no one has ever ‘made it'.
Are insatiably curious: you have a desire to understand the world that can never be fully satisfied.
Practice humility: you don't know everything and you never will; embrace that and learn.
Focus on humans: always feel into the human experience at the other end of the machine.
Are playful: you work hard, laugh hard, and crack jokes in meetings.
Think slow: you choose careful deliberation over brash decisions."

Data Scientist,Retool,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=fc652beea205b951&fccid=d84f54f1c7f8f653&vjs=3,2 days ago,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,5.0,None,"WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU
Retool’s user base is growing quickly, and we’ve found ourselves with an increasing number of questions about our business and product. We’re looking to hire our first Data Scientist to take the lead on analysis and metrics to inform our product, what’s working, and what’s not. Today this work is spread across teams, with our Growth team the primary driver.

We’re looking for someone who is passionate about analyzing data across all domains, motivated by having an impact on the business and is constantly curious. This is the right role for someone who thrives in the blurry space that is data at high growth startup.

WHAT YOU'LL DO
As the first hire in this role you’ll play a pivotal role in building the data culture at Retool. Your scope will be broad — you’ll work with almost every team at the company on problems from analyzing user behavior to architecting our event infrastructure to partnering with GTM teams on forecast models.

We’ll look to you to help us establish KPIs and ensure we have the tooling to measure and access said KPIs. You’ll apply your statistical knowledge to the data questions we face today around product analytics and pricing, and help us think critically about the questions of tomorrow.

We’ve already built out a solid stack on top of Segment, BigQuery, DBT and, of course, Retool, but we need your help to ensure it scales with the company.

Retool is a small but fast growing startup with more questions than answers and we’re looking for someone who is excited to wear many hats and jump in wherever is needed. This means each day will be a little different and we’ll look to you to juggle a variety of projects and deadlines. We are looking for someone who has a bias towards finding a way forward on impactful work.

WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH
You’ll work most closely with Retool’s Growth team, but really you’ll work with almost every team at the company. You’ll be expected to partner closely with internal stakeholders, and help identify areas of need and opportunity within the organization.

THE SKILLSET YOU'LL BRING:
3+ years of experience working with product analytics and an engineering team.
Highly skilled at writing SQL. A strong enthusiasm for SQL, in all its flavors, is a plus.
Experience working with, or a healthy interest in and knowledge of, event driven infrastructure and ETL processes.
Knowledge of common git workflows.
A solution-oriented growth mindset.
Demonstrated experience partnering with cross-functional stakeholders.
Strong communication and presentation skills.
IN THIS ROLE, YOU'LL:
Work with product and business (marketing, sales, success, support) teams to identify key questions and answer them with data.
Develop key metrics and ensure observability via dashboards and other relevant tooling.
Apply analytical skills to understand user behavior.
Regularly communicate learnings to the company.
Lead the collection and modeling of data in our warehouse — from new sources to integrating existing sources.
Work with engineering to implement tracking and debug missing data. Yes, you’ll be jumping into our Javascript code base.
Define tracking best practices.
Be a self starter.

Machine learning and data science are at our core, and we're building a rare computational team that works closely with our biologists, together fighting disease.

Impact
Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases on Earth — cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, muscle wasting, and more — and drugs that slow the biological damage accumulated while aging have the potential to reduce the incidences of these diseases, possibly simultaneously. We believe that in the not-too-distant future, the discovery of therapies for aging will provide some of the most effective tools in history for reducing our burden of disease and extending our healthy lifespan.

Our mission is to dramatically accelerate the realization of that future. And we’re bringing a new set of machine learning tools to bear on this challenge.

Yes, you belong
We are building a cross-functional team. We don't expect you to have a background in biology, just as we don't expect our biologists to be experts in ML. We do expect our teams to work respectfully and closely, learning together every day.

We value building a diverse, inclusive environment and welcome all applicants regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.
About you
Experience. You have 3+ years of real-world experience in data science, software development, or machine learning.
Maturity in face of ambiguity. You help define questions instead of just answering them. You work to resolve ambiguity — and you're comfortable making decisions when it remains.
Analytical intuition. You're comfortable dealing with data and forming and testing hypotheses. You have a developed sense of whether analysis lacks rigor and how to improve it.
Love answering questions that help others. You get energy being faced with a series of questions that are important for others’ work and driving quickly towards answers that help them.
Tends towards ownership. You’re able to lead an analysis from the earliest stages of acquiring data all the way through to reaching conclusions from that data.
Crisp communicator. You excel at crisp, concise written or spoken communication. You love learning and teaching others in a cross-functional team (we're biologists, computational folks, and more).
Driven by impact. You're most motivated when working on a problem of important consequence, no matter what's necessary to do so.

Nice to have
Biological data experience. You bring familiarity with the pitfalls and analytical techniques typically encountered with large biological datasets.
Deep learning intuition. You bring intuition about datasets and experiment structures for deep learning from personal experience.
Scientific background. You have cultural familiarity with scientists and labs from personal experience. You know the language of scientists as well as that of the technical world.
Benefits
Competitive salary and equity in a growing, well-funded startup
Excellent medical, dental, and vision coverage
Generous vacation policy
Healthy feedback-focused environment — leadership will have high expectations, regularly share constructive feedback, expect you to grow, and welcome receiving feedback from you

A unique moment
We have deep support from some of the best investors in the world: General Catalyst, First Round, Felicis, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, pharma/biotech angels, and many more. Our advisors are world leaders in aging research, senior execs at pharma, and top tech entrepreneurs.

And at the same time, we're just getting started. You're joining a team that has the funding needed to be ambitious while still early enough to help define our culture, choices, and success. Our expectations of you — and of ourselves — are high.

"Data Scientist / Software Engineer, Planner",Waymo,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=55a5d877991f852d&fccid=73ceef0a2153d2b8&vjs=3,2 days ago,"Mountain View, CA",None,None,3.1,None,"Waymo is a self-driving technology company with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to get where they’re going. Since our start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has been focused on building the World’s Most Experienced Driver in hopes of improving the world's access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. Our Waymo Driver powers Waymo One, our autonomous ride-hailing service, as well as Waymo Via, our trucking and local delivery service. To date, Waymo has driven over 20 million miles autonomously on public roads across 25 U.S. cities and conducted over 15 billion miles of simulation testing.

The Planner Evaluation team is working on one of the most challenging problems in autonomous driving: building algorithms to assess the safety and quality of our self-driving cars at scale. Evaluation at scale is of paramount importance in solving autonomous driving: the algorithms we build orient the development of planner software by defining the north star and thus enabling rapid iteration. Almost every improvement to Waymo’s planner is influenced by our work, indirectly (by providing the quality signals for onboard engineers to aim for) or directly (by incorporating our algorithms into our onboard motion planning code). This is no easy feat. As our self-driving car gets better and accumulates more miles, we need rigorous and intelligent methods to automatically assess whether a scene is risky, a maneuver causes discomfort, or an interaction with pedestrians or other drivers could be managed better. This can be done through geometric reasoning, simulation, machine learning, and/or modeling with statistical distributions. Developing evaluation algorithms in self-driving is an uncharted space and thus requires true ingenuity. If you are excited about leveraging a large volume of extremely rich data in an area with lots of unexplored territory to help the advent of self-driving technology, this is the place for you!

In this hybrid role, you will:
Develop signals to describe the quality of our self driving car's behavior, using a range of techniques including machine learning, statistics, math, and physics
Design creative uses of simulation to measure those signals
Work closely with statisticians, machine learning engineers, and roboticists to develop novel solutions to open problems

We'd like you to have:
MS in Computer Science, Robotics, Statistics, Physics, Math or another quantitative area
3 years of industry experience
Python especially for modeling and/or statistical computing
Experience with tools for manipulating big data
Experience with machine learning or large scale statistical analysis
Problem-oriented mindset instead of only a solutions-oriented approach

It's preferred if you have:
PhD in Computer Science, Robotics, Statistics, Physics, Math or another quantitative area
Comfort with writing production code in C++
Experience in robotics or with spatial data in another field"

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

An incredible team of fun, humble but brilliant co-workers

Background
Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.
But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.
At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.
Our Company & Culture
We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.
Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.
Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody."

Senior Data Scientist - Behavioral Health,Grand Rounds,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=864175c40bf5054c&fccid=674737b89dda47a6&vjs=3,5 days ago,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,3.4,None,"About us:
Grand Rounds is a new kind of healthcare company. Founded in 2011, the company is on a mission to raise the standard of healthcare for everyone, everywhere. The Grand Rounds team goes above and beyond to connect and guide people to the highest quality healthcare available for themselves and their loved ones. Grand Rounds creates products and services that give people the best possible healthcare experience. Named a 2019 Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and Rock Health’s 2018 Fastest Growing Company, Grand Rounds works with inspiring employers and doctors to empower them to be the change agents we need to make our shared vision a reality.

The Role: Data Scientists at Grand Rounds work on problems that are core to the company’s mission. Major challenges include developing systems and models to identify the highest quality doctors in the country as well as methodologies to uncover the subtle differences between each physician’s clinical expertise. Additionally, patient-level modeling allows us to understand the specific healthcare needs of every person. With a high fidelity understanding of both patients and physicians we are able to route patients to both appropriate and high quality care. In addition to developing the company’s core technologies, data scientists provide decision support analysis for many teams across the organization including product development, sales, marketing, and strategy. Data scale ranges from small data sets that fit on a single laptop to large multi-terabyte clinical information in distributed database systems.

This particular role within the Data Science team will focus on building our behavioral health (BH) related services. The US will be short over 16,000 psychiatrists by 2025, not to mention limitations of other types of BH providers, and the availability/access to/quality of the existing providers. Further, members with BH needs often have other physical conditions and the coexistence of BH needs with chronic conditions may 2-3x the costs of care. This role will use a mixture of structured data and text based data (Natural Language Processing skills a plus) to help identify members’ needs, match members to top providers, and determine which BH providers have the experience in particular domains. It is also a highly cross-functional role, as you will work closely with our Clinical and Product teams to help support our members’ needs during these difficult times.

We are looking for someone with strong NLP experience on difficult applications that recognizes the importance of maintaining a balance between cutting edge techniques and simple, scalable solutions. Having experience in the Behavioral Health space is strongly desired.
Example Projects include:
Predict who may have a BH need. A member’s care can be greatly enhanced if a clinician is aware of BH risks or needs of the member they are speaking with. However, because BH is faced with a negative stigma in the United States or a member just may not know to bring it up, the member may not discuss their BH needs with the clinician. If we can determine BH associated risks that our members face, our clinicians can professionally ask relevant questions to better treat, guide, and route members through the health care system. We strive to build NLP tools and systems to mine our rich text-based data to determine the types of BH risks/needs our members may have. We use the minimum necessary de-identified data to derive insights, and these insights are presented only to the treating professionals.

BH provider quality modeling. Unfortunately, not all providers are equal. Due to differences in judgment, training, and prior experience we find that there is a huge range in the clinical outcomes they can drive. Further, as different providers have different expertise, it is a non-trivial problem to determine which patients are best treated by which providers. Grand Rounds is a leader in the field of determining clinical quality, and we hope to further extend our tooling and modeling expertise to additional aspects of BH. Instead of just going to a generic in-network provider, this effort will help route our members to providers with a proven track record in the specific area of their need.
Responsibilities:
Help imagine and then create the Grand Rounds Behavioral Health offering
Help build the tooling to make sense of rich, largely untapped data assets, including text-based dataLead and develop major projects from end-to-end encompassing planning, design, technical implementation, debugging, roll-out to Product & Engineering, testing, and iteration
Operate at level of sophistication in statistics, machine learning, or computer science that is publication-worthy
Regularly monitor pull requests, perform code reviews, and produce excellent peer reviews on projects prior to shipping to Product & Engineering
Evaluate and experiment with new technologies and tools prior to wider adoption by the team
Work closely with analysts, data scientists, product managers, clinicians, and engineers
Qualifications:
BS with 8+ years or MS with 6+ years or PhD with 3+ years of experience. Degree(s) should be in a technical discipline such as Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, Physics, Math, quantitative social science
Work experience leading complex Data Science and Engineering projects
Experience with NLP techniques for text representation (e.g. n-grams, sentiment analysis, bag of words, vectorization, etc.), semantic extraction / named entity recognition, annotation, summarization, relation extraction, and intent recognition. Conversational agent experience is a plus
Experience with SQL relational databases as well as big data
Required: Python, SQL, Linux Shell Scripting
Frequent user of cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform
Excellent verbal communications, including the ability to clearly and concisely articulate complex concepts to both technical and non-technical collaborators
Business intuition and product sense that help you identify the most impactful projects to work on to address current and future business needs
Bonus Points for: background in Behavioral Health or Healthtech

The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.
We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is truly saying.
We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee & Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few.

Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Mathematical Scientist. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI-Quants.

This role is an in-house mathematician role. As such, you'll be involved in formulating fundamental questions arising as part of the investment process as mathematical problems consistent with our research philosophy, and you'll be responsible for solving those mathematical problems. This role is central to our research efforts, and your output is expected to have a critical impact on our bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term.

The ideal candidate typically loves (and is capable of) testing and proving complex theorems and conjectures of her/his own, but prefers industry over academia as she/he is eager and impatient to see the impact of her/his work in real-life. She/he never shies away from finding closed-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results.

Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.

We strongly encourage applicants to read our blog posts (http://bit.ly/2Jf97aV) prior to applying, in order to get acquainted with our research philosophy and some of our works.

Requirements:
Ph.D. / Post Doc in Maths from a top university or research group, with an emphasis on stochastic analysis, optimization, and/or functional analysis.
Excellent graduate-level understanding of probability theory, stochastic analysis, functional analysis and optimization, as evidenced for instance by a French DEA in maths, or the Cambridge Part III, prior to your PhD in Maths.
Strong intuition to guide the design of reasonable conjectures from the geometry of the problem and background knowledge prior to attempting any proof.
No finance or machine learning experience is required."

A global transition to a plant-based food system will turn back the clock on atmospheric CO2 levels, restore natural ecosystems and reverse meltdown in wildlife biomass.

The easiest - if not only - way to make our civilization sustainable is to eliminate livestock, the most dangerous technology on Earth. But humans won’t give up meat. So we need to make meat better - more delicious and more nutritious, without animals as the underlying production technology. That means that making meat sustainably is the most important and urgent problem for the global scientific community.

Impossible Foods' mission is to completely replace the use of animals as a food-production technology by offering consumers everything they currently value about animal products - and making products that are vastly superior to their animal analogues.

To do this, we are taking a revolutionary scientific and market-based approach. We are inventing efficient, sustainable ways to transform ingredients from plants into meat, fish and dairy foods that deliver all the pleasures and nutritional benefits consumers demand, without the destructive environmental or public health impact.

Our world-class R&D team has been building the know-how and technology platform to produce meat, fish and dairy foods from plants. Impossible Foods is experiencing rapid growth and is resolutely committed to leading all aspects of the plant-based food revolution—from discovery to commercial production. The only thing that will separate Impossible Foods from success and failure is our ability to recruit more world-class experts.

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take the difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Principal Data Scientist,Heap,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=17558384d850d1a7&fccid=2d0e1b12684d00d6&vjs=3,30+ days ago,California,None,Remote,3.9,Easily apply,"Heap is built on a rich dataset of product activity, encompassing hundreds of billions of events across thousands of websites. We've automated the process of capturing user behavior, and now we're now building the next generation of tools to help clients understand and take action on their data.
In this role, you'll research, develop, and productize advanced features for Heap's product analytics platform. These features will guide users' attention towards ""unknown unknowns"" in their data, suggest the right questions to ask, and otherwise decrease the barriers to insights. This is an opportunity to scale your data science knowledge across hundreds of companies: instead of discovering important business insights for one company at a time, here you can turn your knowledge into a product that helps thousands of product managers at once.
You'll iterate quickly on challenging and interesting technical problems. How can we turn an autocaptured dataset of millions of events into quantifiable insights? How can we automatically identify frustrating aspects of a customer's product? How can we help our clients avoid overfitting, and protect them from being fooled by confounding factors?
As Heap's second data scientist, you'll work directly with our CTO and alongside an expert data scientist and engineer on a fast-moving team. As you develop these methods, you'll partner directly with our clients to test your approaches on a variety of datasets. This project is central to Heap's future strategy and to our continued success as the leading product analytics platform.
What you will be doing:
Research and develop novel product features. You'll be solving challenging technical and statistical problems that automate insights for Heap users.
Test prototypes with clients. You'll pair directly with clients to understand their data and business problems, in order to test methods and product features in practice.
Productize and scale. You'll partner with our engineers, designers, and product managers to turn new ideas into practical and statistically rigorous features in the Heap product.
Level up Heap's data science capabilities. We're developing data science as a core competency of Heap. As an early and senior member of the team, you'll help build and scale our technical infrastructure and lead an initiative that's key to the company's long-term strategy.
What we're looking for:
4+ years of professional experience as a data scientist
Expertise in either R or Python. You're fluent in transforming, modeling, and visualizing data to solve a variety of problems.
Comfortable in SQL. Experience with data warehouses such as Snowflake, Redshift or BigQuery is a plus.
Experienced with statistics and machine learning. You're familiar with dangers like overfitting, confounding factors, and multiple hypothesis testing, and you're well-versed in statistical methods for handling such risks.
Practical: you care about finding effective and robust approaches that can be scaled into products, not about using the newest and shiniest technologies.
An advanced degree (PhD, MS) in a quantitative field is optional but preferred.
Strong communication skills: able to collaborate with technical, nontechnical and external stakeholders, including presenting conclusions to clients.
You prefer rapid iteration, and have an interest in proving out ideas and making decisions in as fast a loop as possible.
You can have a lot of fun playing with data.
People are what make Heap awesome. Regardless of age, education, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or any personal characteristics, we want everyone to feel welcome. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive equal opportunity workplace everyone can call home.
Heap has raised $95M in funding from NEA, Y Combinator, Menlo Ventures, SVAngel, Sam Altman, Garry Tan, Alexis Ohanian, Harj Taggar, Ram Shriram, and others. We offer plenty of awesome benefits, and we were named #1 on Glassdoor's Best Places to Work (SMB). We'd love to hear from you!"

We eschew “black box” ML, and often our trained models are created and examined explicitly to shed light on complex data and increase human insight rather than to automate a process. We collaborate with scientists, spacecraft operators, and engineers to identify novel ways that ML and data-driven science can help achieve their goals. Finally, we infuse ML solutions throughout JPL and NASA to bring about a richer, deeper, and more complete understanding of our universe from the Earth to the stars. We measure the success of our applied ML systems in terms of human hours saved, additional discoveries made, or new questions that may be addressed. We also frequently act as ambassadors to science and engineering areas not yet familiar with data-driven approaches by teaching, explaining, and offering assistance to those ready to receive it in the complex and often risk/change-averse arena of space exploration.

Senior Research Data Scientist responsibilities include:
Conduct R&D of ML and related technologies for application to science and engineering challenges
Develop and lead algorithm and data processing methods for airborne and satellite remote sensing platforms, planetary surface missions, and novel instrument designs
Collaborate with domain experts from a variety of natural science and space-related engineering fields
Publicize practical and theoretical work through peer-reviewed conference, workshop, and journal papers
Facilitate the infusion of high quality, data-driven technologies throughout JPL and NASA
Provide strategic guidance on all aspects of data science at the group, section, division, and institutional level
Drive the infusion of data-driven products into JPL missions, components, instruments, and processes
Obtain competitive grant proposal funding, form multidisciplinary teams, and serve as Principle Investigator

The Machine Learning & Insturment Autonomy Group is part of the Instrument Software and Science Data Systems Section which provides expertise across the domains of instrument operations and science data systems with a team of multidisciplinary engineers and technologists. Our engineering teams build and operate high performance data processing, management and analysis systems capable of handling petabyte scale datasets in support of science discovery, research, operations and applications.

The Section supports JPL and NASA missions, as well as other science-based projects. Our research and technology development teams create new onboard and ground based technologies for data processing, analysis, modeling, reasoning, visualization, management, access and analytics that are infused into our data systems.

Qualifications

You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code and an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion for innovation and the excitement of turning wildly disruptive ideas into products that impact the industry at large. We are building Cisco’s next-generation technological innovation by combining machine learning and distributed software with networking technologies.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with hands-on experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of complex and intricate datasets for web and mobile applications. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.
You hold a Ph.D. in computer science, Machine Learning, Statistics, or other data-science related field. You can demonstrate a strong track record in the following areas:
Strong background in statistics and machine learning is required, preferably with 5 to 10 years of industrial experience .
Ability to explore large datasets and find key descriptive and inferential properties in large and diverse datasets. Identify patterns and interactions in the data, and to clearly articulate impact of such data properties on proposed usecases.
Strong programming skills in Python, with an ability to manipulate large and complex datasets using distributed computing technologies (e.g., Apache Spark).

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

Data Scientist (Natural Language Processing),States Title,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=b120eab91feca6be&fccid=c27222fe56b254e6&vjs=3,30+ days ago,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,5.0,Easily apply,"Create the model that transforms the mortgage industry
Want to infuse a $20B sector of the insurance and real estate industry with predictive analytics and a tech-forward customer experience? Yearning for a startup culture within a profitable nationwide company? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.
Every mortgage or refinance transaction requires our product: title and escrow. Title insurance protects banks and homeowners against financially irresponsible actors or legal issues that cloud their rights; escrow makes sure the right people get paid at the end of the day.
In an uncertain real estate market, lenders, banks and realtors are dying to know how to boost their margins. They are switching their customers to States Title because our data science algorithms, streamlined deal closing technologies, and overall product experience is leaps and bounds above what they're used to in terms of speed and value in title and escrow.
Our streamlined algorithms have revolutionized the title and escrow process and allowed us to scale rapidly: we closed our acquisition of North American Title Company in early 2019 to go from startup to #8 in the country. With a broader nationwide footprint and a huge data set for machine learning, we are poised to transform this industry. We will repurpose the billions wasted in rote, manual tasks to make homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.
We're growing our document parsing data science team
We're looking for someone who is fired up to automate the manual labor currently associated with ingesting, reviewing, and reconciling the dozens of types of documents that need comprehension during a real estate transaction. This means everything from using advanced optical character recognition techniques to parse scanned documents, to using natural language processing to check their validity and action them.
As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at Oracle, PayPal, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.
We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.
Do you have what it takes?
3-10 years of relevant experience in data science
Excitement about delivering industry-shaking document parsing algorithms using natural language processing (NLP)
Experience in document processing is a plus, but not required: we will consider all accomplished persons in any area of NLP
Strengths aligned with our needs
E.g. Can you explain how convolutional kernels or attention mechanisms work without making reference to computers?
E.g. When you write a python library that tests the score distribution of incoming orders against expectation, does Engineering praise the quality of your code?
E.g. When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?
E.g. Can you get a group to make a controversial decision in fewer than 30 minutes?
We want to help you do the best work of your life
We believe the most valuable investment we can make — and the greatest boost we can give your career — is an exceptional team of colleagues who are passionate about what we are doing.
We currently offer the following benefits and will continually evolve them with the goal of efficiently attracting, retaining, and leveraging the very highest quality talent.
Our passionate, capable team will always be our #1 benefit
We are proud of the team we have built so far, and we are excited about the team we have yet to add

At AWS AI, we want to make it easy for our customers to deploy machine learning models on any endpoint in the cloud or at the edge. Just as SageMaker provides a complete set of services to simplify the task of building and training a model, Neo provides an inference engine that is designed to run any machine learning model on any hardware. Running machine learning inference on edge devices reduces latency, conserves bandwidth, improves privacy and enables smarter applications, and is a rapidly growing area as smart devices proliferate consumer and industrial applications.

Neo optimizes machine learning models to perform at up to twice the speed of the original framework with no loss in accuracy. Upload a pre-trained model built with MXNet, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or XGBoost to your S3 bucket, choose your target hardware platform from Intel, NVIDIA, or ARM, and with a single API call, SageMaker Neo optimizes the model, converts it into an executable module, and returns it to your S3 bucket. The free open source Neo runtime uses less than 100th of the space of the framework to run the model on the target hardware.

The SageMaker Neo Edge team is building new technology to deliver the most efficient inference on edge devices, coupled with ease of managing these devices. We are hiring well-rounded applied scientists and software developers with backgrounds in machine learning, embedded systems, compilers, and AI accelerators. If you have worked on running high performance computations on embedded devices, done performance tuning, developed software stacks on devices with limited compute and memory resources, you will enjoy working on the breadth of ML applications that we optimize.

You will help develop the runtime for machine learning, work with machine learning model compilers, and enable device and model management. You will engage with silicon vendors and device makers on enriching their on-device and device management service needs. The role offers an extremely broad set of opportunities to work as a full stack SDE with exposure to multiple AI applications, ML frameworks, ML models, compilers, embedded software, service software, and various AI hardware including ARM, Intel, AWS Inferentia, and NVidia.

Join the Amazon SageMaker Neo Edge team to help AWS customers deploy machine learning models on edge devices at scale in production. Work on an open source industry-standard compiler and runtime for machine learning that is already deployed on over 20 million devices.

In this dual role, you will have two critical responsibilities. First, you will manage ML operations activities for Cisco’s central Advanced Analytics organization. In this role, you will lead a team of ML engineers to help our data scientists quickly and efficiently realize value from their models. Key focus areas include model testing, validation, and deployment, architecting / maintaining a reliable infrastructure for data science, and ensuring models deliver maximum value over time within cost and performance constraints. Second, you will be a key driver of Cisco’s AI Everywhere strategy, working with data science leaders and teams across Cisco to accelerate data science impact. This will require supporting the deployment efforts of other teams, establishing a common set of capabilities across the enterprise, promoting standards and best practices, and leading efforts to maximize code sharing and re-use. Who You’ll Work With
You will be part of the Advanced Analytics organization within Cisco's Data & Analytics Office. You’ll be working both with data scientists and ML engineers within our organization as well as building bridges to other data science teams across Cisco to accelerate Cisco’s transition to an ML/AI-driven organization. Who You Are
You are a leader who is equally comfortable developing technical solutions, solving problems across the technical and business domains, and guiding others to be successful with these solutions. You have a structured approach to problem-solving and can communicate clearly, concisely, and in simple terms. You are willing to do things differently to explore new opportunities and know how to validate potential and feasibility quickly. You are passionate about making a difference and working with teams to educate and encourage them to influence change. You can comfortably navigate a large corporation and get others passionate about following your lead while being a technical mentor to others on the team.
Minimum Qualifications for this Role Are

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

"Backend Software Engineer, Machine Learning",Loon,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=0e2619ed92c0a98d&fccid=d6169c6e95113966&vjs=3,30+ days ago,"Mountain View, CA",None,None,5.0,None,"About Loon
Loon is on a mission to connect people everywhere by inventing and integrating audacious technology. Loon is built on a sophisticated system of products and services that combine advancements in materials science, atmospheric modeling, machine learning, and communications systems. These platforms enable Loon to harness the stratosphere, transforming global connectivity and creating endless possibilities for new applications by bridging ground, sky and space.
Overview
Loon's network orchestration stack is a Temporospatial Software-Defined Network (TS-SDN) for networks that span land, sea, air, and space. It was designed from the ground-up to support multiple aerospace networking projects, which until relatively recently included non-geostationary satellite constellations, in addition to the balloon-based production network that it orchestrates today at Loon.
Large enterprises and startups are racing to build their own non-geostationary constellations of satellites and high-altitude platforms to provide affordable, broadband Internet service to the billions of people that still lack access to it. But no single solution can solve the problem; just as population densities on Earth are non-uniform and span roughly five orders of magnitude, the tradeoff between coverage and capacity-density will require five altitude layers (towers, stratospheric platforms, low-earth orbiting, mid-earth-orbiting, and geostationary orbiting satellites).
Enabling the stratospheric layer and the ability for high-altitude platforms to internetwork with the layers above and below is of key strategic interest to Loon. As such, Loon is externalizing its network orchestration stack and transforming it into a multi-tenant production service to enable the internetworking and coordination of the world's aerospace networks.
Loon is seeking an experienced Software Engineer with graph theory, operations research, and machine learning experience to lead development of our next-generation network optimization engine for satellites and high-altitude platforms. This engine will determine the schedule of beam handovers, radio frequency channel assignments, and network paths that should be used, over time, by a heterogeneous network of ground stations, satellites, balloons, solar gliders, maritime vessels, commercial airlines, and end user devices on Earth. It must also minimize network disruption and packet loss as the network continuously evolves - and rapidly repair the network in the face of any unpredicted link failures.
Responsibilities
Investigate and down-select from a number of possible strategies for the next-generation solver.
Align stakeholders and build confidence in your proposed strategy.
Lead a small team of 2-3 software engineers (inclusive) to train and turn-up a production serving model within ~18-24 months.
Minimum Qualifications
Strong understanding of reinforcement learning and contextual bandits problems.
Production experience training and serving traffic using ML models.
Experience designing large scale systems and implementing core components.
Fluency in one of {C++, Go, Java}, with interest in developing proficiency in all three.
Preferred Qualifications
Experience with or interest in aerospace systems including communications satellites.
Experience with or interest in networking, including wireless communications and software defined networks,"

You’re excited about tackling technical problems that most wouldn’t dare touch. Working with unstructured and nontraditional data doesn’t scare you. Data science, predictive models, and statistics are second nature. You excel in building machine learning systems, conducting foolproof analyses, and leading cross functional projects. While banks are busy evaluating 30-year-old FICO scores, created before a time of the internet and smartphones, you’re building models which will decide who to lend to in real-time. Instead of hiring hundreds of people to manually review, you’re adding new data points to ensure accurate scoring. You’re hands-on, creative, and hyper-analytical. You understand that the ultimate measurement of success is enabling patients to afford care in a time of need, with a fair rate, in terms they understand. At the end of the day, you want to change the way credit is evaluated.
What you'll be doing
Designing and developing core machine learning infrastructure
Conducting statistical analyses to assess the value of new data points and vendors
Building and deploying production risk models to improve Finrise patient underwriting
Hiring and leading a team of best-in-class data scientists
What you should already have
Background in mathematics, statistics, or engineering
Some understanding of credit and/or risk underwriting
Bachelors required; Advanced degree preferred
Strong programming ability, preferably in Python
Deep understanding of machine learning and mathematics
A scrappy team player with an ability to thrive and effectively communicate in a fast-paced, numbers focused environment

In this dual role, you will have two critical responsibilities. First, you will manage ML operations activities for Cisco’s central Advanced Analytics organization. In this role, you will lead a team of ML engineers to help our data scientists quickly and efficiently realize value from their models. Key focus areas include model testing, validation, and deployment, architecting / maintaining a reliable infrastructure for data science, and ensuring models deliver maximum value over time within cost and performance constraints. Second, you will be a key driver of Cisco’s AI Everywhere strategy, working with data science leaders and teams across Cisco to accelerate data science impact. This will require supporting the deployment efforts of other teams, establishing a common set of capabilities across the enterprise, promoting standards and best practices, and leading efforts to maximize code sharing and re-use. Who You’ll Work With
You will be part of the Advanced Analytics organization within Cisco's Data & Analytics Office. You’ll be working both with data scientists and ML engineers within our organization as well as building bridges to other data science teams across Cisco to accelerate Cisco’s transition to an ML/AI-driven organization. Who You Are
You are a leader who is equally comfortable developing technical solutions, solving problems across the technical and business domains, and guiding others to be successful with these solutions. You have a structured approach to problem-solving and can communicate clearly, concisely, and in simple terms. You are willing to do things differently to explore new opportunities and know how to validate potential and feasibility quickly. You are passionate about making a difference and working with teams to educate and encourage them to influence change. You can comfortably navigate a large corporation and get others passionate about following your lead while being a technical mentor to others on the team.
Minimum Qualifications for this Role Are
5-7 years’ experience of cross functional technical leadership in an engineering or ML/AI capacity
2+ years experience managing ML / software engineers
Experience architecting and implementing CI/CD pipelines in production environments (ideally cloud-based environments such as GCP or AWS)
Exposure to machine learning concepts (feature engineering, text classification, and time series prediction) and frameworks with interest in learning more
Experience with machine learning lifecycle platforms (MLFlow / Kubeflow). Hands on experience with Kubernetes and Docker.
Expertise in Python
Track record of success in communicating to business decision makers and executives, both in writing and speaking
BS/BA degree in Computer Science or related field; MA/MS preferred. Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

You are a data scientist - soon to be known for building the “thermometer for the mind”: a system that encompasses...
streaming smartphone sensor data providing measures of human behavior,
batched electronic health records providing measures of health outcomes, and
state-of-the-art algorithms that map #1 to #2
... in order to get substance-use disorder patients the help they need at their most critical moments of recovery.
You're excited about changing the way we manage mental healthcare, using machine learning and artificial intelligence. Your modeling expertise is broad - you're familiar with a wide variety of modeling approaches, and you have a depth of intuition to choose the right approach for each task. You keep the end goal of delivering customer value in mind. This means you seek and respond to customer feedback about your outputs, and you navigate your approach towards results. You're more focused on results than tools - though you stay abreast of exciting developments in machine learning, you'll use a simple approach if it's the right one for the job.
You're familiar with best practices for codebase management and data security. You'll create a codebase that is well-documented, elegantly designed, and easy for others to use. And you have a security mindset, which you'll apply to ensuring that our handling of sensitive data meets the highest standards.
You're a visionary who will influence the future of data science & analytics at Aware Healthcare. Your understanding of our goals and of the possibilities of statistical inference will guide our product development, and direct our collection of data. You are excited to effectively manage new collaborators as our data science team grows.
Responsibilities

Who We Are: Aware Healthcare Inc.
Our Mission
Aware Healthcare is on a mission to build the “thermometer for the mind”: a digital medical device that delivers real-time measures of clinical risk to providers, about their patients, at the moments they need it most.
The current gold-standard of evaluation in psychiatry are pen & paper surveys that provide subjective, episodic, high-burden, and clinic-based measures of risk. Our thermometer allows providers to check the ‘mental temperature' of their patients — in an objective, continuous, ecological, and passive fashion — at any time.
Our Vision
With our thermometer, providers know who needs help, and when they need it. Not only does this shine light into the black box that currently defines life outside the clinic, but it allows providers to deliver just-in-time interventions to patients before it's too late. Trust in providers grows when patients know they're being looked out for. Population health flourishes when high-risk gets detected early. Per capita costs plummet when rates of readmission are reduced. Welcome to the triple-aim of healthcare.
We envision a world where we all have the vocabulary to describe how we're mentally feeling; self-awareness to identify when we're heading down a dark path; and tools to get help in minutes not weeks. We can't manage what we don't measure, so we see no more important problem than this for technology in healthcare.
Our Why
We are starting with addiction for several reasons. For one, it seems we've all been affected by or lost friends and family who have struggled with this chronic disease. Two, addiction is the most costly, preventable, and unmanaged disease in America; costing our nation over $700 billion per year and leading to over 70 other comorbid medical conditions. Three, most digital health companies have run away from addiction, because they see the problem as ‘too hard'; the patients as ‘unmanageable'; the suffering as ‘inevitable'. With over 16% of Americans meeting criteria for clinical addiction, and another 32% classifying as risky users, we see this as too big of a problem to ignore.
Join us in redefining what it means to know thyself, reconsidering how we measure population health, and revolutionizing the way we manage mental healthcare. Join us at Aware Healthcare.
How We Will Collaborate: Culture & Values
Work Culture
We're a small team looking for someone who's passionate about democratizing self-knowledge; relentless about getting help to those who need it most. You should be comfortable exploring outside your comfort zone; be ready to learn and constantly take on new challenges.
You should be known by your colleagues for never compromising on quality, while always moving quickly. On our team, no one is expected to know everything, but everyone is expected to be capable of learning independently, and applying that knowledge effectively.
This is a fast-paced role with many concurrent responsibilities, and it comes with a great deal of ownership. Chances are you will grow more in this role than any other role of your career. This idea should excite you, rather than scare you.
Team Values
Being on the Aware Healthcare team means you...
Take ownership: the buck stops at you; you are individually responsible.
Are proactive: you take initiative; identify problems before they happen.
Embrace risk: take courageous & calculated risks; no one gets banished for making mistakes.
Are radically candid: you expect truth and nothing but the truth; give & take constructive criticism.
Have a growth-mindset: we believe you can always be better & you should too; no one has ever ‘made it'.
Are insatiably curious: you have a desire to understand the world that can never be fully satisfied.
Practice humility: you don't know everything and you never will; embrace that and learn.
Focus on humans: always feel into the human experience at the other end of the machine.
Are playful: you work hard, laugh hard, and crack jokes in meetings.
Think slow: you choose careful deliberation over brash decisions."
