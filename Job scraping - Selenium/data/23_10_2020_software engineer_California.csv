At IBM, you will use the latest software development tools, techniques and approaches and work with leading minds in the industry to build solutions you can be proud of.

Your Role and Responsibilities
Are you interested in pursuing a software development career? Have you heard about agile development, but want to learn more about how it ‘works’? Are you someone that has a foundational understanding of development or programming concepts, but want to take a less traditional path to achieve it?


What is an Apprenticeship?
IBM Apprenticeship Program, which lasts approximately 12 months, is an official registered apprenticeship recognized by the Department of Labor (DOL). Every graduate of a Registered Apprenticeship program receives a nationally-recognized credential from the DOL.

During the apprenticeship duration, you will be required to complete specific learning hours and on the job training that has been outlined to ensure you are developing the skills and competencies essential to the role. You will be able to learn and grow at your own pace, but we expect most apprentices will complete their learning within 12 months. Once you graduate and receive your certificate from our apprentice program, you will be eligible to apply to available full-time roles at IBM.

Who you Are
An apprenticeship is about learning. We’re seeking candidates who have the following requirements, but we know you’re just getting your career started, and we’re committed to helping you learn and grow.

Design Thinking
Hypothesis driven development
Social coding
Agile principles
Container development using tools such as Docker or Vagrant
Application Development, DevOps automation, and the development toolchain (e.g. Travis, Jenkins, Junit, automated test tools)

What’s the Experience?
As an apprentice, you'll join with other apprentices in a local cohort. You'll go through your first few weeks together, learning about IBM and the skills you'll be attaining throughout your apprenticeship. Then, you'll work with your managers and mentors to progress through your personal skills roadmap, learning and demonstrating new knowledge and competencies through hands-on application with your project teams. You'll complete milestones along the way, earning digital credentials to validate your skills, and will come back together with other apprentices to participate in on-going training and development focused on your professional and technical skills.

As a Software Engineer Apprentice at IBM, you’ll work as part of a larger team of experienced developers and mentors in an interactive, collaborative environment. You’ll learn the fundamentals of development, software design, testing, and cloud computing, agile principles, IBM Design Thinking, DevOps and continuous delivery. You will also learn how to resolve IBM customer issues, debug customer problems and environments, and increase Cloud Service skills, and will build the skills to grow your career as a Software Developer. Best of all, you are a contributing member of your team, putting forward ideas, taking on responsibilities and making choices about how you get the job done just like any other IBMer.

Our product lets you watch your favorite shows on all the devices you care about, with seamless playback, insightful discovery, and effortless sharing — in short, we're building the TV experience that we've always wanted for ourselves.
We're a company that puts people first — both our subscribers and our team. At Philo, our philosophy is to empower our colleagues to do their best work while supporting each other in pursuing shared goals. We value pragmatism, pride in our work, and passion. We believe in having transparency and openness across all parts of the company.
We are committed to diversity and inclusion as we grow the Philo team and shape the future of TV. We believe that a diverse set of voices and perspectives on our team enables us to innovate faster and create the best experience for our subscribers.
Philo is headquartered in San Francisco, with additional offices in New York and Cambridge, MA. Our leadership team includes a cofounder of Facebook as well as alums of Meraki and HBO. Philo is backed by NEA and industry partners including Discovery, Viacom, AMC, and A&E.

Hack the Full Stack

Philo's engineers hack up and down the technology stack. It's not uncommon for a Philo engineer to go from backend coding to user experience design, from the video encoding pipeline to system scalability, from site maintenance to iOS/Android development. Philo engineers own what they build from start to finish. We ship to production multiple times per day and keep unnecessary process to a minimum so we can maintain our pace of rapid development.

We are actively hiring engineers who are looking to build a completely new kind of product and who have a passion for back-end and/or front-end development.

Infrastructure

Philo's infrastructure consists of thousands of connected machines in nearly 100 data-centers across the country, with new machines spinning up every week. Philo is harnessing petabyte storage and petaflop compute power in a highly distributed environment. Our systems ingest roughly 50Gb of video per second, then transcode, segment, and encrypt it to deliver live television to our users. Meanwhile, our DVR storage system writes millions of episodes to disk every day. We operate in two different environments: on commercial cloud infrastructure, as well as within the unpredictable world of remotely managed hardware in a wide variety of hosting environments across the country.

As a backend engineer you will be responsible for:
Brainstorming, designing, implementing, and rolling out the next generation of Philo's system to handle an order of magnitude more channels, users, and recordings.
Developing our video pipeline: building a highly available transcoding, segmentation, and video hosting and storage system.
Automating system configuration: since we're a small team, constantly deploying both new hardware systems and code in cloud infrastructure, we have no choice but to heavily automate our infrastructure.
Hacking on our monitoring and management system: we graph, track, and alert on all kinds of metrics up and down our stack, giving us important insight into performance trends and helping us catch issues before they impact our users.
Finding cheaper, faster, better solutions: both in our cloud environment and our hardware-based systems, we're always trying to reduce costs and improve our product.
We are language agnostic, but most of our server-side code is written in Golang, Node, and Ruby, with some C++ and Python. Our centralized infrastructure is built out on Kubernetes, and we practice continuous deployment across all of our systems.
Projected Start Date: ASAP
Status: Full-time
Location: San Francisco, CA
Compensation: Includes competitive salary, company stock options and health benefits.
We value a diverse and inclusive workplace and we welcome people of different backgrounds, experiences, skills, and perspectives. Philo is an equal opportunity employer.

We are a collaborative and supportive team. We measure our individual success by how well our team does and by how well we push each other to grow professionally. We believe teams should have significant say in what they build and how, and therefore should be responsible for the eventual success of what they're building, whether it's in ensuring customers can use it or sales people can sell it or support people can support it. As part of Imply, you'll get exposure and ownership over how whatever you build fits not just with the rest of the product but with the rest of the org.

The focus of this role is on distributed system engineering, where you will be heavily involved in the development and technical direction of the open-source Apache Druid project and how Druid works within the larger Imply product offering.
You might work on:
Building distributed ingestion systems that can handle throughput rates in the tens of millions of records per second (RPS)
Implementing scalable query engines capable of sub-second analysis of hundreds of gigabytes of data
Creating systems that provide fault tolerance and consistency in an environment with 100s to 1000s of nodes
Ideal experience and skills:
5+ years of experience building distributed fault-tolerant systems such as Cassandra, Kafka, or Zookeeper
Exposure to Big Data systems such as Hadoop, Presto, Spark, ElasticSearch or relational databases like MySQL or Postgres is a strong plus
Knowledge of the internal workings of data warehouses like Teradata, Snowflake, Redshift, AzureDB, or BigQuery
Experience developing high concurrency, performance-oriented Java systems
