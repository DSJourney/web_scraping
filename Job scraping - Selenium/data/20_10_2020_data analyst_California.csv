ABOUT OUR CLIENT
Our Client is one of the two experienced franchise and multi-unit institutional private equity investors in the United States.

It is the most advanced technology platform of any venture or private equity firm and they can share a 50 page PowerPoint presentation as context of what it is.
They have invested $1.5M building a technology platform, starting after they acquired large data sets from the social web in 2014. They have since expanded their capability to gather data and process data. They have been approved by investors to invest heavily in accelerating the development of the platform.

While their platform is well developed, there are still plenty of opportunities for both technical and process improvements in achieving their desired outcomes more effectively - locating and analyzing attractive companies/franchises to add to their investment portfolio.
They are looking for a Business Analyst to start using the platform, gathering interesting companies, and partner with their management team to gather additional requirements and make recommendations for how to improve their process and platform.

Help run investment searches to locate attractive opportunities
Make recommendations for how to improve and optimize search criteria, process, platform, and reporting

Qualified candidates will be invited to do a screening interview with Braintrust's core team. We will answer your questions about the project and our platform. If we determine it is the right fit for both parties, we'll invite you to join the platform and create a profile to apply directly for this project.

WE ARE CISCO
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We need a forward-thinking individual who can drive innovation at Cisco in data and analytics, to continuously improve the technologies, tools, and approaches we use, and to identify and incubate high-potential new analytics use cases.
You will build and nurture a trusted, professional network across Cisco's operating units, to discuss their needs and opportunities in data and analytics, and to help them get to the next level of data-driven decision-making. Likewise, you will develop a network in and beyond Silicon Valley to connect with startups, venture capitalists, universities, and other corporates; identify standard methodologies, new technologies, and potential partners for Cisco; and work towards incubating these at Cisco hand in hand with your Cisco-internal network of partners.
You will build and oversee a lab in which high-potential startups and your Cisco partners will co-create solutions for Cisco's unique needs and opportunities based on strong outcomes where everyone wins. You will identify these startups, introduce them to your network of internal partners, broker and negotiate partnerships, and guide and support those partnerships to enable maximum impact.
Who You'll Work With
You will join Cisco's Data & Analytics Office, a team of high-caliber professionals passionate about data and analytics, and excited to help Cisco transition to an increasingly strong culture of data-driven decision-making.
Who You Are
You are a charismatic, hand-on ""maker"", passionate about innovation in data and analytics. You excel at leading without authority. You are a structured thinker who can communicate clearly, concisely, and in simple terms. You are willing to take risks to explore new opportunities and know how to validate their potential and feasibility quickly. You can navigate a large corporation and get others passionate about following your lead.

Our minimum requirements for this role are:
You hold a Master's degree with at least 5 years' meaningful experience
You have experience successfully managing sophisticated projects and/or programs.
You are a self-starter who thinks and acts independently.
You have a sense of ownership, are output-driven, and enjoy working iteratively.
Experience working with a SaaS company is a plus.
You will get bonus points for exposure to the venture capital ecosystem.We Are Cisco #WeAreCisco , where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool."

Quickbooks is used by over 5MM SMBs globally to run their businesses and we are the team responsible for using our data to answer the most critical questions facing the QBO Product Managers and Marketers.

We are growing rapidly and need great people to support ouranalytical efforts in both Product and Marketing.
What does it take to thrive on our team? You need to be a top-notch problem solver and problem identifier as there are no points for an elegant solution to the wrong problem. It’s also a good idea to know the standard suite of analytical tools - SQL, R/Python, some sort of data visualization tool - but more importantly you must know how to learn tools quickly. We also often find that having a bit of a software engineering mindset is valued too - much like good software solutions, good analytical solutions are scalable and repeatable as this is what allows us to solve a problem once and go tackle the next one. Last, knowing that in most cases done is better than perfect is important - getting the current problem right to the sixth decimal place is almost always less impactful than getting to the next problem.
What you'll bring
5+ years of experience in generating and sharing insights from product/marketing data to educate effectively and instill confidence, motivating stakeholders to act on recommendations
Technical experience including SQL, some form of coding (Python, Scala, etc), and ETL/scheduling such tools as Airflow

Are you intrigued by the thought of disrupting a trillion dollar industry through technology? At Opendoor, we’re on a mission to make it simple to buy and sell homes. The traditional process is broken, with an average home taking over 90 days to sell and costing thousands of dollars. We empower everyone with the freedom to move by making buying and selling a home stress-free and instant. We’ve built an exceptional team, seen strong growth, served over 80,000 customers (with an annual run rate of $5 billion), and raised $1.3 billion in funding. With Covid-19, the world is changing, and real estate is no exception. The coming years present a tremendous opportunity for innovation as we explore new frontiers and scale nationwide.

About the team
In the past five years, Opendoor has expanded rapidly to 21 cities and buys and sells billions of dollars of homes per year. But, our vision is to empower everyone with the freedom to move, which necessitates making the Opendoor experience more affordable, consistent, and customer friendly in existing markets, while we also expand our coverage into new markets.

The Operations Excellence team reports to the President of Homes & Services and is responsible for driving many of Opendoor’s most complex and cross-functional priorities from inception to scale. We use technology and process improvement to refine a very complex operating model that powers “the freedom to move”. Our scope spans the minute a home seller receives an offer from Opendoor, ends with our reselling each home we buy to the next customer, and touches hundreds of processes in between from inspecting each home before we buy it, to renovating homes to we own, to negotiating contract terms with buyers. We make both linear and step change improvements to continue to elevate how we serve customers across all of our existing markets, and expand our core platform and adjacent products (e.g., Buy with Opendoor, Mortgage) to additional markets.

Our core team of ~15 professionals supports an org of approximately 700 people. We combine biz ops, product ops, launch and analytics and engage with a wide range of teams across the company, but define ourselves by our mission and the results we achieve, not functionally.
You will:
Partner with operators and Ops Excellence teammates to drive strategic projects to improve our operations, and help scale them across the business. You’ll be responsible for identifying what analyses need to be done as well as surfacing insights and making recommendations
Own dashboards that help everyone from operators to senior leadership manage their P&Ls and most important metrics
Improve analytics infrastructure at Opendoor by creating new data tables, modifying source code for existing tables, and ensuring everything is documented
You are:
Quantitative and data driven: every decision and initiative at Opendoor starts and ends with what the data tells us. You’re experienced in designing analyses to prove or disprove hypotheses, and you look to data not only for the “what” (“what’s happening in our business?”) but the “so what” (“why does this matter and what is it telling us about potential next steps?”)
A systems thinker: you’re a strategic thinker who can go deep on a business and understand its core drivers; you’re also biased to action and know that the true test of an idea comes when we try it out in the real world.
Highly collaborative: You’re excited about working across all of our regions and across all levels of the organization: with our leadership team, our functions, our GMs, and our city operations teams. You’re comfortable not just surfacing data-driven insights but communicating them effectively as well.
Customer-first: You care about our customers, and you understand that we exist, first and foremost, to serve a customer need. Selling a home is stressful and emotional, affecting a our customers’ largest asset. You’re mindful of that in everything that you and the team do.
Hungry and energetic: You’re determined to become an expert on Opendoor data and help our operators meet ambitious goals
Qualifications:
2-5 years of work experience with 1+ years in analytical role
Proficiency in SQL and visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Mode, Looker, etc.)
Self-motivated and excited about driving operational excellence
Excellent verbal, written, and visual communication skills

Amazon is focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees while continuing to serve people who need our services more than ever. Regular testing on a global scale across all industries would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running. But, for this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available. Unfortunately, today we live in a world of scarcity where COVID-19 testing is heavily rationed. Until we have an effective vaccine available in billions of doses, high-volume testing capacity would be of great help, but getting that done will take collective action by NGOs, companies, and governments.
We are seeking a highly skilled and a motivated team player to be part of a dynamic metrics and dashboard team. This team is focused on looking at internal rate trends and finding the keys to help accelerate the lab process.

To do this,

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

We are growing rapidly and need great people to support our analytical efforts in both Product and Marketing.
What does it take to thrive on our team? You need to be a top-notch problem solver and problem identifier as there are no points for an elegant solution to the wrong problem.

We also often find that having a bit of a software engineering mindset is valued too - much like good software solutions, good analytical solutions are scalable and repeatable as this is what allows us to solve a problem once and go tackle the next one. Last, knowing that in most cases done is better than perfect is important - getting the current problem right to the sixth decimal place is almost always less impactful than getting to the next problem.

W hy Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

We are dedicated to tackling one of our nation's biggest problems with ingenuity, creativity, and a keen moral compass.

Nuna is committed to simple principles: a rigorous understanding of data, modern technology, and most importantly, compassion and care for our fellow human. We want to know what really works, what doesn't—and why.

Nuna partners with healthcare payers, including government agencies, health plans, and employers, to turn data into learnings and information into meaning.
YOUR TEAM
Nuna's products are built to help deliver value-based care, at scale, across the United States healthcare system. Value-based healthcare is a delivery model where providers are paid based on patient health outcomes, instead of traditional fee for service arrangements, driving delivery of higher quality care for patients at lower cost. Today, value-based care is incredibly difficult to operationalize so we're making it easier with products that enable automated, accurate, and transparent operation of value-based payments.
YOUR IMPACT
In this role you'll work as part of a cross-functional team of engineers, healthcare data experts, product managers, and customer liaisons to expand, adapt and configure Nuna's data products towards the delivery of accurate and scalable value-based payment solutions. Along the way, you'll help customers understand what key capabilities our products provide, how to implement and migrate their existing processes to our products, and to identify ways to leverage our product technology to deliver measurable business value. You will also help Nuna's product and engineering team understand clients' needs and pain points to inform product roadmaps.
YOUR OPPORTUNITIES
Lead, coordinate and train team members in supporting and building products for healthcare plans and providers.
Identify and understand clients' needs and pain points in operationalizing value based payment arrangements. Translate and distill them into systematic tactical plans to support scoping and prioritization of development work.
Solicit, interpret and document client business requirements and value based payment methodologies.
Lead and coordinate efforts to verify and validate Nuna's implementation of clients' value based payment models
Collaborate with Product Managers, Engineering, and Design to identify and design new ways to extend Nuna's products to better serve customer needs.
YOU BRING
Bachelor's degree or above in quantitative or engineering fields (Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Health/Medical Informatics, Computer Science, or similar)
6+ years of experience working with healthcare data paired with a passion to connect with, understand, and shape the healthcare industry.
4+ years of client facing experience in the healthcare industry; Strong verbal and written communication skills.
Keen attention to detail and deadline driven.
Proficiency in SQL
BONUSES
Experience with value-driven payment arrangements, healthcare financial models or provider quality measurement strategies.
Experience working at or with health plans or providers.
Experience with Enterprise Software deployment

Nuna is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics and/or veteran status."

We are looking for a great data scientist for our Quickbooks Online (QBO) business. Quickbooks is used by over 5MM SMBs globally to run their businesses and we are the team responsible for using our data to answer the most critical questions facing the QBO Product Managers and Marketers. Everything from understanding the trends in our subscriber growth to shaping our product strategy through A/B testing and more happens within our team and we need top data scientists to help the business deliver the best possible product to our SMB customers. We are growing rapidly and need great people to support our analytical efforts in both Product and Marketing.
What does it take to thrive on our team? You need to be a top-notch problem solver and problem identifier as there are no points for an elegant solution to the wrong problem. It’s also a good idea to know the standard suite of analytical tools - SQL, R/Python, some sort of data visualization tool - but more importantly you must know how to learn tools quickly. We also often find that having a bit of a software engineering mindset is valued too - much like good software solutions, good analytical solutions are scalable and repeatable as this is what allows us to solve a problem once and go tackle the next one. Last, knowing that in most cases done is better than perfect is important - getting the current problem right to the sixth decimal place is almost always less impactful than getting to the next problem.
What you'll bring
5+ years of experience in generating and sharing insights from product/marketing data
Technical experience including SQL, some form of coding (Python, Scala, etc), and ETL/scheduling such tools as Airflow
Experience with data visualization tools such as Tableau, Superset, etc.
Experience working with SaaS-based subscription metrics including conversion, retention and product usage is preferred
Entrepreneurial spirit and passionate about data
Masters degree in a Quantitative Field
How you will lead
Solve marketing and product analytics problems by doing work such as developing data structures, pipelines, and data visualizations that enable us to find insights and take action by working with click data, event data, user provided data, third party data, and more
Strong experience in A/B testing
Perform analyses that inform decisions on everything from retention strategy to product experience using predictive and descriptive analytical techniques
Communicate findings from analyses in a way that enables business leaders to make better decisions"
